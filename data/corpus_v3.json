    "text": "These past months have seen a massive increase in the number of coins on the Binance Smart Chain. Despite this explosion, it is evident that the majority of these tokens represent, at best, a mediocre investment opportunity--if they do not outright rug or soft rug, they often fail to deliver on their promises of increasing the wealth of their holders.\n\nMOONGOLD Strives to ensure that you are not just confident, but are dead certain that your investment will bring back a solid ROI without the worries that conventional tokens today bring. This space is still plagued by obvious hazards like rug pulls, minting exploits, and a myriad of other ways that contract creators can take advantage of unaware investors. Investors deserve better and should demand better.\n\nWe find it that keeping things simple works best in the financial world, we focus on a community-centered atmosphere as well as providing progressive and dynamic milestones in a roadmap-like format that are associated with certain events and giveaways.\n\nFor example, at 10,000 holders, the \u201cHYPERION\u201d milestone is unlocked, bringing with it flash mobs, plane/billboard banners, giveaways, and more.\n\nOwnership is 100% Renounced, Liquidity is locked forever\n\n\u270510% Transaction fee\n\n\u27055% Distributed to holders\n\n\u27055% Added to liquidity\n\n\u270575% Burned from the total supply \ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\udd25\n\n\u2705Holders accumulate extra tokens overtime\n\nOf course, a token alone is not sufficient to guarantee long term growth. In this rapidly moving space the team needs to constantly deliver. Fortunately the MOONGOLD developers intend to, and already have a professional website, and a roadmap of dynamic milestones.\n\nIt has been a while since I have seen a token with so much professionalism, and one where the team is clearly thinking of the average investor. Of course, you should always DYOR, but in my mind this is a no brainer.\n\nVerified Address: 0xb8da571e307e38b0a9d54967757573b05b7e99cb\n\nBuy on PancakeSwap: https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xb8da571e307e38b0a9d54967757573b05b7e99cb\n\n\ud83d\ude80Telegram: https://t.me/MGOLDToken\n\n\u26a1\ufe0fWebsite: https://www.moongoldtoken.com/",

    "text": "Arguably one of the BEST real charity tokens on BSC. Evolution Token has been growing at a steady rate since its launch nearly 1 week ago. It recently pumped from a 5K market cap to 2M+ and has been slowly consolidating and killing whales before its next move up.\n\nThe community is awesome, and a giveaway for 20B EVO is even going on on their Twitter right now!\n\nLike the rest of the Crypto market, it's taken a bit of a downturn in recent days, however this is a confident hold for me. I held when I 50x'd (day 1 investor) and I even bought more at the top and I still confidently hold. The team is as transparent as it gets, and communicates everything to the community well. I'm so sick of being rugpulled from shit coins being shilled on CMS...I literally sold everything and just hold EVO. When you know what you own and own something real...none of these memecoins matter.\n\nThings In The Pipeline For Evolution\n\n\u2022 100 Tree Donation To TeamTrees once it hits 1000 holders (any day now)\n\n\u2022 Monthly community decided donations starting once 1000 holders are reached.\n\nFirst charities that will be in the vote are 1) Coral Resotration Foundation 2) The Water Project 3) Trees For The Future 4) Actions Against Hunger\n\n\u2022 Total Website Redesign (mock ups completed, will be going live very soon)\n\n\u2022 Quick Audit completed and passed, full audit is in the works\n\n\u2022 Multiple exchange listings in the works\n\n\u26a1\ufe0f Tokenomics\n\n\ud83c\udf33 500T Max Supply\n\n\ud83c\udf33 220T+ Already BURNED\n\n\ud83c\udf33 10% Transaction Fee (Slippage @ 12)\n\n\ud83c\udf33 5% Reflections To Holders\n\n\ud83c\udf33 5% Added To LOCKED LP\n\nEvolution has a CoinGecko listing PENDING, and is already listed on CoinSniper, CoinHunt, and CoinVote! The FULL contract audit is in the works, and should be coming as soon as possible! (Quick audit already done and can be seen on their website) There is a huge budget for influencer promotions and much more. That 2M pump was without a single dime spent in advertising, all organic according to the devs!\n\nWhy keep buying shitcoins, when you can own something real? Why miss your chance to be a part of the EVOLUTION!\n\nWebsite - https://www.evolutiontoken.com\n\nTG- EvolutionTokenBSC",

    "text": "**About Atlas NFT**\n\nAtlas is the first NFT Exchange that will allow you to buy, sell, and trade NFTs regardless of which crypto you so desire. If a seller only accepts Bitcoin, a buyer can pay for the seller's NFT with Atlas Tokens (or any other crypto) through the Atlas NFT exchange and the seller will receive Bitcoin while the buyer will instantly receive their purchased NFT! This is only possible through the Atlas Exchange!\n\nWith the Atlas NFT BEP-20 Token, all of this is made possible. The Atlas Token acts as the bridge between the gap between any and all cryptos. Allowing it to be possible to exchange NFTS regardless of the crypto combination in a single transaction.\n\nThe Atlas NFT BEP-20 Token also displays many features that put that asset's investors in mind.\n\nOne of the main features of the Atlas Token is the Anti-Whale Tokenomics that are in place. While trading Atlas you will be bound to a certain buy and sell limit that set proportional to the current market cap. Meaning no single holder is able to dump the price in a single transaction. Additionally, no single holder is able to hold more than 5% of the total supply.\n\n**Token Features**\n\n*Liquidity locked forever*\n\n*Ownership renounced*\n\n*0% Dev Team Tokens Prior to Launch* (devs buy atlas tokens with everyone else at launch)\n\n*Anti-rug tokenomics (max buy limit of 2 BNB in the beginning to prevent whales from being created)*\n\n**Socials and Links**\n\n**Telegram**\n\n[https://t.me/atlasnftbsc](https://t.me/atlasnftbsc)\n\n**Website**\n\natlasnft.org\n\n**Twitter**\n\n[https://twitter.com/atlasnft](https://twitter.com/atlasnft)\n\n**External Audit**\n\n[https://atlasnft.org/pages/external-audit](https://atlasnft.org/pages/external-audit)",

    "text": "$StopElon started off like most potential moonshots, with a vision and a out of reach plan. We are becoming so much more however. People from all around the globe are sticking up against the effects of manipulation from Elon Musk and his lies and deceit he used to post a $100m profit on Q1 for Tesla. Billions and billions of USD was lost from investors around the world just so he can barely scrape by with his nonprofitable company.\n\nIf you live in the Bay Area, do not miss out! StopElon team has acquired a Tesla and wrapped it in our new branding. It looks incredible. They will be driving it around Saturday, and the community is hosting a event on Sunday, June 6th 12pm at Tesla factories in Fremont, California. Our new merch will be revealed, as people that attend get free shirts, masks, water and more!\n\nTesla workers deserve a union and fair wages. Elon doesn\u2019t care however, and profits millions off their lack of rights while he also profits off of average investors by manipulating crypto. No one person should have this much power, money, and benefit off of the financial losses and sufferings of the common man, in the way Elon Musk does.\n\nWhat no one envisioned however, was how there would be many converging factors that could allow this community to grow & become a rallying point for everyone that is fed up with the rich and powerful not only profiting off of market manipulation, but also; Lack of workers rights, Anti-Union policies, and especially the non stop taking advantage of poorer counties. These people have left the everyday person in their rear view mirror, while they get richer and richer.\n\n$StopElon is available on Telegram in (18) different languages as the community has pitched in to design our ecosystem in a way that encourages coin holder engagement. Our community is very active and we have daily voice AMAs with the chat. \n\nUpdates:\n\nThe team did it. We are officially signed on a contract to be listed on a significant exchange. The devs said we skipped over minor exchanges, our tokenomics will be supported in the form of airdrops, and we with trade under STEL/USDT and STEL/ETH. This is big. \n\nDaily social media giveaways have started. So do not miss out. Something as simple as just a retweet and a follow can give you many chances to win over the next week! \n\nStopElon has been completely rebranded with new a logo, telegram stickers, and an whole new website. \n\nNews is completely going crazy again. Elon is in heat with SEC. As shown on CNBC, WSJ, CNN, and more. Also, we are back in the headlines! Firstly, Forbes Mexico/Columbia/Central America. Then News Au, Hlb be, Laptopmag, and Nzherald. As always, fascinating how word wide this movement is.\n\nWhen it comes to progress on the actual goal, a core team member, Devacor, has made great progress. After talking to a lot of people regarding legal advise, we are looking to create a voting trust. This voting trust can have shares added to it, and many members have already pledged to add the first shares. Meaning, that we are making our first steps towards Tesla\u2019s HQ.\n\nWe have continued to gain holders, now at 21,950+ and total transactions have now surpassed 62,000\n\nCheck our TG for daily updates\n\nTokenomics: 0.1% max buy/sell 10% tax total (to holders and LP) 40% initial burn (almost 50% burn as of now!) 5% dev marketing wallet 5% community wallet $21M+ Marketcap 21,950+ Holders\n\n\u2705 Verified contract 0xd83cec69ed9d8044597a793445c86a5e763b0e3d\n\nTwitter: STOPELON (@STOPELON_BSC) / Twitter\n\n\ud83d\udcf1English Telegram (@StopElon_BSC)\n\n\ud83c\udf10 Website: www.StopElon.space\n\n\ud83d\udcc8Chart: https://charts.bogged.finance/?token=0xD83cec69ED9d8044597A793445C86a5e763b0E3D\n\n\ud83e\udd5e Buy (v2, slippage 12%, 0,1% max) : https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xd83cec69ed9d8044597a793445c86a5e763b0e3d",

    "text": "Hi Everybody. I'm a member of the Inu Private community and wanted to let ya'll know about this great opportunity!\n\n# What is this Project about?\n\nThe project was started by ordinary people like you and me. They have also invested in various projects before, but there was often a pump and dump, which caused them to lose the value of their investments.\n\nSo they thought, why not create a token by themselves, which is managed by the community and is getting promoted the best way possible? You can think of it this way: If a person makes a suggestion, e.g. to update the logo or to get listed on a certain exchange or change the utilization purpose, then this is getting executed by the admin team. Effectively, it is not the team that determines the progress and the path the token takes, but the members of the group. Major changes will be decided by democracy voting in the groupchat.\n\n# Marketing\n\nApplications to Exchanges and Listings \ud83d\udd8a\n\n\u25cf CoinSniper \u2705 \u25cf CoinGecko \u2b1c \u25cf CoinMarketcap \u2b1c  \u25cf Bogged Finance \u2b1c \u25cf WhiteBit \u2b1c\n\nPlanned \ud83c\udfaf\n\n\u25cf Accounts on major social media \u25cf Reach out to influencers \u25cf New website \u25cf Merch Store \u25cf Dex Listings \u25cf And much more!\n\nTokenomics\n\n\u25cf Total Supply: 10,000 \u25cf Burned 5,000 at Launch \u25cf Fair Launch\n\n\ud83d\udc25Telegram: ([https://t.me/InuPrivate](https://t.me/InuPrivate))\n\n\ud83c\udf10 Website: ([http://www.InuPrivate.com](http://www.InuPrivate.com))\n\n\ud83c\udf70PancakeSwap: ([https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x43937eA71A81aFFCfA16cF17B28494B923C060df](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x43937eA71A81aFFCfA16cF17B28494B923C060df))\n\n\u2705Locked Liquidity: ([https://mudra.website/index/?certificate=yes&type=0&lp=0xe6D80171191dcBF1a8e48Cf6409eeDc0a2b2BfBa](https://mudra.website/index/?certificate=yes&type=0&lp=0xe6D80171191dcBF1a8e48Cf6409eeDc0a2b2BfBa))\n\n\ud83d\udcb0Renounced Ownership: [https://bscscan.com/token/0x43937ea71a81affcfa16cf17b28494b923c060df#readContract](https://bscscan.com/token/0x43937ea71a81affcfa16cf17b28494b923c060df#readContract)\n\n\ud83d\udcd1Contract: 0x43937eA71A81aFFCfA16cF17B28494B923C060df",

    "text": "UltraSafe Just Reached 36k+ Holders - Marketing & multiple CeX listings underway, already listed on CG and CMC\n\nHey UltraArmy!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst & foremost I would like to invite you to join 36,000+ holders in this wonderful token of the future. Lets face it, markets have been scary recently. With fear at an all time high, it has never been easier to pick your next investment. Why? Well it's simple. Investing into a coin marketing off of security & safety is more brilliant than ever. Simple right? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUltraSafe is fully rug-proof. UltraSafe has its liquidity locked for 79 years, its contract ownership has been renounced, & two official audits completed by Solidity & Certik. With an aim to complete a third audit down the line we are truly in line to being the safest most secure coin on the market. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, why should you invest? Let\u2019s think about current trends in crypto. A great example here is SafeMoon. SafeMoon has its success attributed to selling the idea of safety. But, SafeMoon isn\u2019t as safe as it\u2019s all cracked up to be. A quick comparison of audits show huge vulnerabilities in SafeMoon which have been corrected in UltraSafe. We are here to put the product behind the name. With 2 audits completed showing higher safety ratings then SafeMoon, we think you\u2019ll agree that we are where your investment should be. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere for tokenomics? Ultrasafe is unique in that it allows for 4% of every transaction to be distributed to the liquidity pool while reflecting another 4% to holders. This helps consistently reduce the impact that selling has on our coin while rewarding those who hold. 8% tax helps to secure longer investments from whales as well as avoid standard pump & dumps. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat's making me most bullish about this coin? Well, honestly the team is incredibly well connected. Coingecko listing at launch & an audit already completed alone is unheard of. Lbank, CerTik, CMC, Banners, Planes & Broadway Times Square Billboard in 2 weeks? No worries there. We now have confirmed a 8.8m TikTok follower in the works. Incredible. This team has smashed every record the scene & BSC currently offer & plan to continue to bullrun right up to the top. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nConsistently updated WhitePaper with clear goals & wonderfully thought out vaults focused around marketing, it is clear they know what they are doing. Plans are clearly actively working to put this coin to the top. With recent movements like ones they just secured with TritomBux where you can earn coins, UltraSafe is just getting started.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe community is strong, connected & engaging to say the least. With new Exchanges in the works nearly every Catalyst still remains. The team has shown amazing transparency regarding marketing money, so you know what's going on while they consistently follow through with their incredible roadmap to success. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe team has doxxed themselves by showing their faces & names during both AMA\u2019s. Future full dox has been planned while currently some staff are doxed fully on their website. It is worth noting to be listed to any CEX or on CoinGeck/CMC you must be fully doxed to their team. So while a full public dox isn\u2019t currently available the team is fully doxed to the proper entities needed for liability. With that being the case, an LLC that is required for other CEX listings is near completion. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are many incredible plans down the line for UltraSafe. With multiple things in the works, including: dApp, NFTs, UltraWallet, UltraSafe Exchange, merchandise store, CEX listings(already in talks with 3 more currently), More AMA\u2019s, Influencer & Social Media oriented marketing, Billboards, Planes, Times Square, outsourced & animated Website v3 & major news articles this team has a lot going for it. Don\u2019t be surprised to hear even more soon as these come to fruition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe\u2019ve had some large holders, but \u201cBig Whale Randall\u201d, a successful crypto investor, takes the cake. Currently our largest holder, \u201cRandall\u201d had invested 500k towards the beginning of our second week into our project & has assured investors he is here for the long run! The community saw this as an amazing sign of faith in such an early project. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith so many options to consider UltraSafe makes it easier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith higher growth than standard savings accounts there is no smarter place to park your money. It is currently an amazing entry point as we ride strong momentum along with the crypto recovery. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe hope to see you join the UltraArmy while making your safest investment yet!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nImportant Links:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite: [https://ultrasafe.finance/](https://ultrasafe.finance/)\n\nCoinMarketCap: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ultrasafe/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ultrasafe/)\n\nSolidity: [https://solidity.finance/audits/UltraSafe/](https://solidity.finance/audits/UltraSafe/)\n\nCertik: [https://www.certik.org/projects/ultrasafe](https://www.certik.org/projects/ultrasafe)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.gg/hy54dHhjvk](https://discord.gg/hy54dHhjvk)\n\nTwitter: [https://mobile.twitter.com/ultrasafebsc](https://mobile.twitter.com/ultrasafebsc)\n\nTeleGram: [https://t.me/UltraSafeOfficial](https://t.me/UltraSafeOfficial)\n\nReddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultrasafe/](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/Ultrasafe/)\n\nBscScan: [https://bscscan.com/token/0x0b3f42481C228F70756DbFA0309d3ddC2a5e0F6a](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0b3f42481C228F70756DbFA0309d3ddC2a5e0F6a)\n\nFaceBook: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/503406880704284/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/503406880704284/)\n\nStockTwits: [https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ULTRASAFE.X](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ULTRASAFE.X)\n\nMost Recent AMA: [https://m.twitch.tv/videos/1036054617](https://m.twitch.tv/videos/1036054617)\n\nFirst Live AMA: [https://youtu.be/FcyQYBk4wU4](https://youtu.be/FcyQYBk4wU4)\n\nCoinGecko Listing: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ultrasafe](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ultrasafe)\n\nDexTools: [https://www.dextools.io/app/pancakeswap/pair-explorer/0x48bac97d5e3116626a56704be7399e1cb593a945](https://www.dextools.io/app/pancakeswap/pair-explorer/0x48bac97d5e3116626a56704be7399e1cb593a945)",

We expect it to be fully tested by Monday. We'll open source the code and share it with the community before we launch!\n\n**Selling**\n\nWhen a person sells QuickBounty, they get taxed. This tax is based on the amount of days the person has held the token.\n\nAs days go by, the tax is reduced.\n\nAny fee collected from \ud83e\uddfb\u270bsellers goes to the \"bounty\" contract, explained below:\n\n**The bounty**\n\nYou will be able to earn BNB straight from the bounty. There will be two ways to earn money from the bounty:\n\nWhenever someone buys, they have a chance to take a % of the bounty.\n\nStaking will be the main way to get back from the \ud83e\uddfb\u270b bitches.

    "text": "**Folks, this coin will be a huge one, we are launching very shortly, and are doing it quite discreetly but want to get some devoted members before we launch.** All coin details below.\n\nThese past months have seen a massive increase in the number of coins on the Binance Smart Chain. Despite this explosion, it is evident that the majority of these tokens represent, at best, a mediocre investment opportunity--if they do not outright rug or soft rug, they often fail to deliver on their promises of increasing the wealth of their holders.\n\nMOONGOLD Strives to ensure that you are not just confident, but are dead certain that your investment will bring back a solid ROI without the worries that conventional tokens today bring. This space is still plagued by obvious hazards like rug pulls, minting exploits, and a myriad of other ways that contract creators can take advantage of unaware investors. Investors deserve better and should demand better.\n\nWe find it that keeping things simple works best in the financial world, we focus on a community-centered atmosphere as well as providing progressive and dynamic milestones in a roadmap-like format that are associated with certain events and giveaways.\n\nFor example, at 10,000 holders, the \u201cHYPERION\u201d milestone is unlocked, bringing with it flash mobs, plane/billboard banners, giveaways, and more.\n\nOwnership is 100% Renounced, Liquidity is locked forever\n\n\u270510% Transaction fee\n\n\u27055% Distributed to holders\n\n\u27055% Added to liquidity\n\n\u270575% Burned from the total supply \ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\udd25\n\n\u2705Holders accumulate extra tokens overtime\n\nOf course, a token alone is not sufficient to guarantee long term growth. In this rapidly moving space the team needs to constantly deliver. Fortunately the MOONGOLD developers intend to, and already have a professional website, and a roadmap of dynamic milestones.\n\nIt has been a while since I have seen a token with so much professionalism, and one where the team is clearly thinking of the average investor. Of course, you should always DYOR, but in my mind this is a no brainer.\n\n\ud83d\ude80Telegram: https://t.me/MGOLDToken\n\n\u26a1\ufe0fWebsite: https://www.moongoldtoken.com/",

Well 10% of every transaction is taxed and goes towards the prize pool. This means that the more people who participate, the larger the prize pool. Our launch prize pool ended up being 12BNB, so imagine if we get 1000s of players, the prize pool can easily turn into 100BNB.

    "title": "ArenaCoin just fair launched! New BSC token mechanics! Buy $ARENA and earn BNB! | Round 4 has begun! | Participate in the events to win!",
    "text": "Draw your weapons warriors because it is time to enter the $ARENA once again! We will be launching again for 24 hours! This round is going to be big because we're taking new big steps for the marketing. This project sets out to gamify meme tokens by having players invest short-term in order to win prizes in BNB. (Learn more here: [https://arenacoin.gg/](https://arenacoin.gg/))\n\nNow you may be wondering, where does this prize money come from? Well 10% of every transaction is taxed and goes towards the prize pool. This means that the more people who participate, the larger the prize pool. Our launch prize pool ended up being 12BNB, so imagine if we get 1000s of players, the prize pool can easily turn into 100BNB. (Telegram: [https://t.me/ArenaCoinGG](https://t.me/ArenaCoinGG))\n\nNow you're probably asking yourself, how can I win this money? Well let me describe the possible events that occur during the coin's launch.  \n\n\n**King of the Hill**  \nThe person to make the purchase of at least 0.1BNB worth in tokens that increases its price to the all time high will win 15% of the prize pool.\n\n**Sharpshooter**   \nThe person to purchase 0.1BNB+ worth in tokens at a specific time will win 10% of the prize pool. The time will be random between a minute interval and a randomizer will choose the winning time! Purchase must be within 10 seconds of the time and if there are multiple purchases at the same time, the person who received the most tokens win.  \n**Last One In**  \n15% of the prize pool would be given to the person who makes the last purchase of 0.1BNB before the rug pull occurs!\n\nDepending on the round, a few of these events will show up but King of the Hill and Last One In are permanent events that will appear in every round!\n\nTime left till the round starts is listed on the website!

    "text": " \n\nHey anon. Anon here.\n\nI\u2019ve been investing in the BSC space for a while. I\u2019m going all into PinkPanda, and I think you should too. (Not financial advice)\n\nIt\u2019s not every day that a brand-new memecoin on BSC drops a mobile app for both iOS and Android within a week of launch. It\u2019s also not every day that a community-driven coin has big plans to develop a mobile-first, elegant exchange that supports 5x leverage. And it\u2019s extremely rare that you see popular influencers, from Money Talk to Finance Bull, raving about a brand-new community coin within the first week. There\u2019s even an upcoming live chat with Travladd, who has over 80K subs.\n\nMost importantly, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a community as jaw-droppingly active and HUNGRY as all of the pandas in the community are. They are hungry for something new in BSC--a project that delivers on its promises (launching a mobile app within a week is just insane) and is truly community driven. They\u2019re hungry for bamboo and have hands of such solid diamond that they have trouble eating it.\n\nSo yeah, anon. Drop into our TG or Discord and join the community. I think you\u2019ll like it. Ask for the writer of this post if you want to chat--I\u2019m a member of the community just like anyone else, and would love to welcome a new panda.\n\nDue Diligence stuff: Contract renounced.

Well how about a little game centered around that? Basically, there are two coins made, one called FLOYD and the other called LOGAN - if there's a knockout during the match, the liquidity for the coin of the dude who gets knocked out gets sent to the other coin - as I said, giga degen but can be easy af money. If there's no knockouts then the liquidity for both coins remains intact.\n\nI'm placing my bets on there not being a knockout since it would be bad optics for both parties, but with that said, I feel like most people will be better on floyd, so some good money can be made here.\n\nThe tokenomics on both coins are the same, 10% transaction fee of which 5% goes to liquidity and the other 5% getting distributed to holders.\n\nThis is also quite early btw.

Marketing began week 3\n\n16% of the supply is burned. The burn wallet also accumulates Reflection/Redistribution tokens like any other Glitchy wallet, and those are manually burned to create a constant deflation of supply.\n\nAccumulating LP Tokens are manually burned as soon as they accumulate to approximately 10% of the available liquidity.\n\n**WHY GLITCHY?? Because Holders are Rewarded Fairly:**\n\nOther BNB Reward tokens penalize those who forget to claim, are unable to claim, or in the case of small stakeholders, when the gas fee to make the claim transaction outweighs the reward. Most of these tokens require users to claim daily \u2013 if these rewards are not claimed, they are typically redistributed to the other holders who in time can lay claim to them. This creates a disproportionate system where only the savvy or whale holders truly benefit. Glitchy\u2019s foundational concept is fairness to all holders, whether crypto veterans or noobs, whales or small fish.\n\nGlitchy does not require users to claim in every cycle. Users BNB claims are distributed in proportion to their percentage of holdings of the total Glitchy supply, and the rewards generated every week belong entirely to the wallet that holds the Glitchy. BNB REWARDS ACCUMULATE IF THEY ARE NOT CLAIMED. For example, if a user were entitled to .5BNB Rewards in Week 1, chose not to claim, then was entitled to 1BNB in Week 2 and chose to claim, the entire reward would be 1.5BNB.\n\nThe fundamental difference between Glitchy and other reward tokens on the market now is that Glitchy allows flexibility in the claim function and ensures that claims are never lost or taken by other holders. No other token does rewards like Glitchy.\n\n**No-Lock, No-Stake, No-Penalty:**\n\nGlitchy does not require any external staking or locking of funds in order to generate rewards. Your Glitchy stays exactly where it should \u2013 in your wallet, earning all the time. As explained above, BNB Rewards are never penalized (except in the case of a sell, where your percentage of holding decreases and Rewards will decrease accordingly in the following claim cycle).\n\n**Community and Outreach:**\n\nGlitchy has built a strong holder community through Telegram and Twitter. There are dedicated team members in development, marketing, and Telegram customer service. With a global group of holders and team members, Glitchy is able to execute marketing campaigns and answer user questions 24/7.\n\nUpcoming Marketing Campaigns include additional Reddit/Twitter postings and giveaways, crypto-focused YouTube promotions, AMA\u2019s, and a redesign of the dApp with updated UI/UX.\n\nGlitchy is for Everyone.

    "text": "I am bringing this here to show people what true transparency and a legit project look like:). \n\nAll the important links can be found on the bottom if you dont feel like reading and want to DYOR :). \n\nCryptocurrency has been a stressful game to be apart of recently. With large capital investors shifting the market in whatever way they choose, numerous rug pulls, scams and honeypots are all pushing away new investors and making it stressful for current ones. Rarely do we see a project with great potential get posted on this subreddit, and I have been here for quite sometime. \n\nThe devs are very adamant of this aswell. They simply ran their own tests and were saddened with what they discovered. They bought into 20 projects and only 3 of them turned out to be legit. It is starting to become a common practice in crypto and it really is sad. Crypto is meant to unite.\n\nMatador Token is looking to change that. They are creating an enviroment where investors can actually see their funds grow, not watch them disappear. \n\nFirst of its kind tokenomics discourage any whale from buying and selling large quantities and the completely transparent devs make certain this coin is unrugable. How can one keep away whales? Simple. The sale tax is set at thirty percent. Twenty percent is distributed to holders, five is burned, five is sent to pancake swap for liquidity. You might think they are crazy for setting such a high sales tax however this is to discourage whales from shifting the market and ensuring long term investors their investment will grow. \n\nThe community is also incredibly involved and love the project. A voice chat is held in telegram almost daily, for some to ask questions and others to just chat. Its better to feel comfortable in your investment, instead of worrying when it will vanish. \n\nThe details:\n\nTheir tokenomics in details are as follows: \n\nTotal supply: 1,000,000,000,000,000 \n\nBurned(as of 3:09PM 05/31/21): 479,080,369,524,547 \n\n30% tax on sales \n\n20% redistributed to holders \n\n5% burned \n\n5% added to liquidity \n\nThe burn address: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 \n\nContract audit has been submitted and is pending. \n\nEach dev wallet can be seen in real time and is provided on the website!\n\nThey are already listed on cmc and coingecko. They have their excess dev tokens locked and will be released on schedule as follows. \n\nDev wallet: 32 trillion tokens are locked for one year, while 8 trillion tokens are liquid. \n\nMarketing wallet: 93 trillion tokens are locked and relased as 3 month, 6 month, and 9 month lockups. 1 trillion coins are currently liquid. \n\nOperating wallet: 15 trillion locked for three months. 3 trillion liquid \n\nTemporary lock: 243 trillion tokens have been locked, per community vote, and are being saved until a final decision is made, the lock can extend at any time. These are meant to be for liquidity on new exchanges. \n\nThe extras:\n\nWith all that said. Now couldn't be a better time to secure your position. With large plans, and determined devs, I could see this coin flying high. That isnt the only reason tho ;),\u00a0 Matador token is running a raffle to have another way to give back to the community! \n\nThe Running of the Bulls 2022 will be one of the biggest fiestas yet. Since the event gets 1 million visitors a year, the pent up demand from two years will be over-the-top.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0The Running of the Bulls 2022 dates are July 7 \u2013 14, 2022 in Pamplona, Spain.

    "text": " \tWinter Moon currently has innovative utility as financial instrument, with future use-cases in the works.\n\nWinterMoon is a hyper-deflationary currency with automated reflection and liquidity, granting it unique properties. For each transaction, there is a 6 percent tax. Half of that tax, 3 percent, is redistributed to all other WinterMoon holders in the form of reflection. The remaining 3 percent is used for liquidity.\n\nThese \"tokenomics\" aid price stability and incentivizes holding for several reasons:\n\n1\u00ba The burning of tokens creates a constriction on supply.\n\n2\u00ba The transaction tax creates a disincentive to sell.\n\n3\u00ba During periods of high-volume volatility, more reflections are distributed.\n\n4\u00ba It is far more costly and difficult for day-traders to artificially manipulate the price.\n\nOverall, think of WinterMoon as a high-yield financial instrument, like an ETF, that leverages taxation on volume to provide a percentage yield to its holders. All of this makes WinterMoon an excellent store of value. The fact that it automatically allocates liquidity is just icing on the cake.\n\nIn addition, new utility is in the works, such as NFTs and gaming. And because WinterMoon has very high liquidity, this unlocks incredible DeFi potential (e.g., lending) aimed to provide financial services for the unbanked -- which is 1/3 of the world's population.\n\nAll of this makes for a winning formula: powerful tokenomics that grant exciting current and future utility. \u2744 \ud83c\udf15 \ud83c\udf40\ud83d\ude80\n\nNow team is preparing the launch on 5th of June at 23:00 UTC.\nVERY HIGH GROWTH POTENTIAL.\nHuge Marketing after the launch!!!\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Telegram: t.me/WinterMoonOfficial \u2744 \ud83c\udf15\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Website: wintermoonofficial.com/",

Here is your chance for life-changing money!\u203c\ufe0f",
    "text": "This 100% community-driven project is just 6 weeks old. I'm convinced this is your chance to join a strong, loving community that will only grow . Let me start with some beautiful stats:\n\n* 200k+ holders\n* 35Mill MC\n* Almost 40k members in their Telegram group\n* 50k+ Twitter followers, millions of Tweet impressions\n* 12k+ TikTok followers\n* 10k+ Instagram followers\n* Growing Discord Members\n\nThe most important part: you are still early!\n\nSafemoon Cash got on CG recently\n\nCMC? HELL YES!\n\nCMC is always a huge trigger for any project but will continue be even more so for Safemoon Cash. The original Safemoon has been the most searched for crypto for weeks now on CMC. We are right up there when people search \u2018safemoon\u2019 ;)\n\n**Why is Safemoon Cash special?**\n\nFirstly, we are not the next Safemoon, rather, we are the 1st Safemoon Cash!\n\nSafemoon Cash is, in short, a rug-proof, ownership-renounced, 100% community-driven project that will, inspired by Safemoon, bring a multitude of use cases to the world of crypto. Bitcoin Cash reached an ATH of 0.25 Bitcoin. The first goal is for Safemoon Cash to reach 25% of Safemoon\u2019s peak market capitalization.\n\n**So why is Safemoon Cash different than Safemoon?**\n\nFirst of all: it is totally rug proof and community-driven. Nobody 'owns it', as ownership of the smart contract has been renounced and they can't touch their LP. Safemoon has a manual LP and Safemoon Cash has an auto-LP. Also, their tokenomics are superior to those of Safemoon. With its high transaction tax, it\u2019s the early holders of Safemoon that profit most. Every Safemoon Cash transaction incurs a 4% tax to the benefit of all. Safemoon Cash gives holders passive rewards (2%) through static reflection. 2% of each transaction is locked away in the Safemoon Cash liquidity pool, to create a steadily rising price floor. Safemoon Cash burned the liquidity after launching the token.\n\n**What has Safemoon Cash been up to and what's coming?**\n\nThey got a very driven and talented team that's in it for the long run. They have already achieved a lot and are just getting started:\n\n1. Techrate Audit and Rug Detectives Audit\n2. Listed on Delta, Blockfolio, CG, CMC, Stocktwits and many more\n3.

Now's the best opportunity to get in and HODL some $EJECT tokens\n\n\nA Kickstarter Type Platform For New Altcoins\nEJECT will host the most promising up and coming projects on the BSC, and will offer the guarantee that all projects that make it to our platform are safe to invest in. We will allow most projects to appear in our platform, but will help investors distinguish between \"real\" projects and \"meme-coins\". We will also do complete audits and screenings before posting any project. \n\nAltcoin Launch & Funding on One Integrated Platform\nOur team has imagined a marketplace where the success of a new project is not decided by the marketing that goes into it, but its actual use-case. This will allow innovative projects to float above the rest, and give a solution to developers who have limited starting funds. We will not only host and audit, but offer assistance to developing teams in launching their ideas. \n\nUnprecedented Investor Protection from Rugpulls\nEject will create a safer environment for investors and let innovation thrive. As of today, the best ideas are diluted by the ever increasing rise of \u201cmeme-coins\u201d and \u201cshitcoins\u201d. We implement a wide array of strategies to prevent investors on our our platform from RugPulls, Pump and dumps, and whales \n\nWebsite: www.eject.space\nTG: https://t.me/EjectElonCommunity",

That was the goal when Vanity was made.\nVanity is aiming to be the leader in distributing to its customers custom vanity addresses, providing an High Quality service and product.\n\n\n# Get in now!\n\nIs recommended to read the litepaper on the website.\n\nYou can find the website, and all the necessary information in Vanity telegram channel in the pinned messages. Hope to see you there!\n\n# About Vanity\n\nVanity is a token that is intended to fully revolutionize the current system with boring old wallet addresses. How do Vanity intend to do this? The team is able to generate custom addresses based on your own preference utilizing GPU Hash Calculation Power to get a match with your request. Keep in mind this project requires high calculation power, so in order to make it a stable service, the team has already purchased GPU Servers being able to hold the upcoming requests!\n\n# How to make sure that your address cannot be compromised and is Safu?\n\nThe detailed explanation will be given below, but in short it\u2019s actually not that complicated. The user will generate a Private and a public key, using one of Vanity\u2019s tools (Disconnected from the internet). Now the user needs to keep this private key to themselves, and send us the Public key. This is a key that cannot grant anyone access to your wallet, only the private key is able to do this. Now when the team has the public key, they can generate any custom address you want. The team will send you back the generated hash, and combined with your private key, those can be merged in your desired address, making you the sole holder of the private key as well.\n\n# Basic Tokenomics:  \n\nThe token has a total supply of 10B tokens At the start 2.5B tokens have been burned. 2% of all transactions go to a burn pool, the tokens will stay out of circulation forever 4% of all transactions will get redistributed over all holders. 2% will go the server bills/marketing wallet\n\nFor every purchase made in the store Vanity will also burn 50% of the spent tokens and redistribute another 20% to the holders once more. Making this a very deflationary and rewarding token in general.  \n\n#Here's how you can join the community  \n\nWebsite:  vanitytoken.net     \nTelegram: t.me/vanitytoken    \nPancakeSwap: https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x2de161f13ab594aecd8f2a93e885a08d0ad362c7  \nContract: 0x2de161f13ab594aecd8f2a93e885a08d0ad362c7",

Asked him to check out WeedShare!\n\nThis token Just launched 1 week ago and already got some major Weed influencers on board. We're happy to announce that Rapper and Weed enthusiast Mason Ray Parker has agreed to repeatedly promote WeedShare on his Instagram. We'd like to extend a warm welcome to him and his 1.7M followers. \n\nPablo Heman, with his 33k followers is a giant crypto influencer, which should skyrocket WeedShare to a new ATH. Simultaneously we're running a Poocoin ad-campaign to push on all fronts, so don't miss your chance while the mcap is still so low!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What's WeedShare?**\n\nWeedShare is a deflationary token on launched by an international team (Canada, Germany, Italy) on May 28th.\n\nThe goal is to create an exchange platform that provides a secure and discrete form of exchange for the Cannabis industry. WeedShare is looking to partner with established players in the industry (both production and retail) to introduce our protocol as medium of exchange.\n\nAt the same time, WeedShare plans to help organizations continue the fight for legalization efforts of cannabis around the world. This includes the use of cannabis for both medical and recreational uses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why is WeedShare different**: MultiSig Enforced Wallets\n\nAs an added security feature for the community of WeedShare, the Gnosis Safe MultiSig platform was implemented. This smart contract wallet requires a minimum number of people to approve every transaction before it can occur.\n\nThis means that a multi-signature sign-off from the whole WeedShare team is required for any transaction. This includes our personal tokens but also a specifically created marketing wallet.\n\nAs part of the WeedShare community, you benefit from this, because it means that none of the core team will be able to sell their tokens and leave you with the bags. This is a long term project for us - this is why we've protected ourselves from rogue team-members.\n\nInfo\n\n* \ud83d\udcc4Litepaper on weedshare.org\n* \ud83d\udd10Team wallets locked (on-chain guarantee!)\n* Devs Doxxed\n\n \n\n**Milestones**:\n\n* (DONE) Twitter partnerships by \\\\@cryptopolica (60k followers)\n* (DONE) Partnership with Aerodrop\n* (DONE) Listing on CoinSniper\n* (Done) Listing on Coinhunt\n* (DONE) No1 Trending on GemSpree\n* (DONE) CoinGecko listing applied\n* (Ongoing) Partnership with weed influencer and musician Mason Ray Parker\n* (Soon) More partnerships with people in the weed community\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Current Roadmap**\n\nQ2 2021\n\n* Promotion and growth of a strong community\n* Influencer Campaigns\n\nQ3 2021\n\n* Listings on Gecko and CMC\n* Talks with business customers like coffee shops about accepting WeedShare\n\n(see our website for the extended roadmap)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tokenomics**\n\n* Total supply: 420,000,000,000,000 (of course it is)\n* \ud83d\udcb010% Tax\n* 5% redistributed to every holder & burned\n* 5% added to liquidity\n* \ud83d\udd12 Liquidity Burned\n* Pancakeswap V2\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Let's Share**\n\n* \u2705 Contract: 0xf4571308b708a1d4632d8e50b4460da1ef6494e5\n* TG: t.me/WeedshareOfficial\n* weedshare.org\n\nTOGETHER WEedSHARE",

    "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nIt\u2019s been just over a week since I last posted asking where to find new tokens, and some of you gave really helpful responses and information \u2013 the sentiment was generally that I needed to go away and learn more about the market in general, and then find a four leaf clover to secure that Moon-shot. It appears also I can turn on Tweet Notifications for Elon Musk and pretty easily ride the wave based just on that (Looking at you CumRocket). \n\nSomeone however did DM me following my post to put me on to what they use to find new tokens, and boy can I tell you that has elevated my progress. \n\nThey added me to a discord group called the \u2018ShitCoinScanner\u2019. It uses some kind of code to pull new tokens every 15 minutes based on how fast they\u2019re growing. It also runs them through something called bscheck and gives loads of like safety information that I would otherwise have to check through the code to find. Absolute lifesaver. I started off taking little risks, then followed the general investor rule I read about of investing 10% of your holdings and things really took off! I\u2019m up about 10,000% from what I started a week ago and I felt like I ought to share it for the benefit of some of the people who likely saw my original post and were wondering the same thing!\n\nIf you want to join, the discord link is: [https://discord.gg/8mqxu5w7](https://discord.gg/8mqxu5w7).\n\nThey\u2019re all really helpful in the discord and it\u2019s so friendly so I hope to see some of you in there \ud83d\ude0a",

With utility such as DragonSwap in the future paired with a charitable focus, DragonMusk will be a business that would cause ripples in the Defi space\n\n&nbsp; \n\nThe established team has taken their own money, time and effort to develop the strong foundation necessary for such a thriving community.

    "text": "I'm bullish as hell on QuickBounty. It's a new token and NOT a copy + paste. The devs have been active in the chat giving details and soliciting input from community members all prior to launch.\n\nIt's completely unique and based entirely on building buy pressure. We keep seeing clones of SafeMoon that pop up with no use case or no changes from inexperienced devs, but this one has a team that is really laying it on the line to make something special.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe idea behind it is this:\n\n\\-Presale will \"whitelist\" buyers to benefit from a halved tax rate upon selling\n\n\\-Sellers taxes get sent to a \"bounty contract\" and the liquidity pool\n\n\\-Seller taxes decrease depending on the length of time the tokens were held\n\n\\-Buyers are eligible to win a % of the bounty contract at random\n\n\\-Holders can solo-stake their coins and drain the bounty contract\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's pretty simple: buyers and hodlers win, paper hands lose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey just unloaded a 15 page whitepaper that goes over their 6-month marketing strategy, their roadmap, the tokenomics, and their funding. It's SERIOUS.\n\nThey haven't announced an official presale date but have already been running banner ads and plan to let the community know soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want to learn more, check out their Telegram community.

    "text": "This is your chance to get in early on the **future of BSC charting tools.** The 2nd version of the SWASS DApp goes live Saturday Night! SWASS is changing the game with **in-depth charting, wallet management, risk assessment, tracking, trade indicators, and more.** They are dropping the 2nd demo release so far built in react. There is a chance to get in SWASS now before the 2nd release and the MAJOR 3rd release which will bring this Dapp to market!\n \n&nbsp;\n\n**SWASS** is a \"store-of-wealth\" token that is **100% community driven**, and built on \"deflationary tokenomics\". It has locked liquidity for 80 years, and publically renounced ownership of the contract.\nSWASS incentivizes both investors, and advertisers through a (DApp) portfolio management platform, and engaging advertisement portal. **The platform that we build will provide any user with advanced portfolio management tools such as; price analysis, risk assessment, customizable UI, tracking of wallets, transaction history, launch progress, & more.** In addition, \"higher-tier\" DApp features will be accessible when the connected wallet holds a minimum balance of SWASS.\n \n&nbsp;\n\nIn plain English: **Swass is building a killer charting tool for bsc that is soon gonna scoop up a huge market share** from Poocoin/BOG which are slowly being phased out. The dapp is getting released in the next few days and timing for CoinMarketCap listing could not have been better. Also they have **3 devs working around the clock on  use case applications for this token.** Considering that CG listing is supposed to happen soon aswell, we are looking at a legit moonshot since the market cap is extremely undervalued at just $1m mcap\n \n&nbsp;\n\n\n **Audit has just been passed few days ago and the whitepaper has been released.** In addition to locked liquidity and\nprofessional dedicated team, this makes Swass one of the safest moonshots that has a HUGE potential upside.\n \n&nbsp;\n\n\n \ud83d\ude80 PancakeSwap [V2] 11% Slippage: exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?inputCurrency=0xEFbA8b41e3495ad52258DFe916199Dc643F99dA2\n \n \ud83d\udcc8 Poocoin Chart: poocoin.app/tokens/0xefba8b41e3495ad52258dfe916199dc643f99da2\n  \n \ud83d\udcac Telegram: t.me/swassfinance\n  \n \u24c2\ufe0f CoinMarketCap: t.me/swampassann\n  \n \ud83c\udf10 Website: swass.finance/",

Find a solid project or app that aims to eliminate the chances of this happening to you again!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is where HyperDeflate Token (HDFL) comes into play. When the dev team got rekt one too many times they decided to take action, after brainstorming and discussing the major issues that plague the crypto community they decided to develop a mobile app that tells you (in understandable terms) if a project is a rug, honeypot, or has nefarious code. Access to this unique application, will be available for purchase only with HDFL.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo not only is this a utility token, it also pays to hold through burns. Here is the rundown of the tokenomics:\n\nWhen you hold, your token balance remains constant. Whilst holding, other transactions will occur and the 10% burn will decrease the total supply of HDFL. E.g - At $1m market cap, with $1m daily volume, 10% of the remaining supply is burned leaving the same liquidity, but attributable to less tokens (at a constant price)\n\nYou may have noticed posts from Hyper Deflate over the last few days and there will likely be many more.

    "text": "$TASTY Token Launches in 30 minutes\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou rarely see a gem with this much backing. I saw the community grow from 0 to over 2000 without any paid advertising. All word of mouth. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first presale started on the June 4th and and it was a total flop. Why? They had over 450 Whitelist signups and invitations were sent out to the signups only to find they were backlogged by email providers like Gmail. Not accounting for the world time difference the team also made the timer for 3 hours! Not ENOUGH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere\u2019s what they did. An immediate voice AMA with the whole team - they admitted to their mistakes and the email flaws. Picked up their boot straps and delivered on their promises! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next presale same \\[400 hard cap\\] and a 24 hour countdown. Filled in under 1 HOUR! That's crazy stuff! Going from 20% filled to a completely stuffed presale is unheard of. That\u2019s the power of an awesome team.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI personally missed the presale, but I am apart of the Influencer Chefs a designed and orchestrated group of social influencers backing the TASTY project on Twitter, TikTok, YouTube and Reddit. Also planning to MAX buy on launch, which is in less than 2 hours. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHeres a few reasons why I'm bullish on this project, firstly their unexpected voice AMA, it\u2019s amazing to see a real and passionate team. Secondly, go have a look at their website [https://www.tastytoken.co/](https://www.tastytoken.co/) Are you joking?!! It\u2019s definitely TASTY. They also created over 35 individual locks that are on a scheduled vesting that is managed by Deanne (Sous Chef) - financial transparency is a must for me. As an added bonus, one admin (or chef) is always in the chat honesty and accurately answering all questions; Yes, even wen moon and lambo \ud83d\ude02\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, what are they trying to do?, They have Michael the Chef de Cuisine who has a strong background in gaming and mobile apps. They are designing hyper causal games to integrate with the TASTY currency in both competitive and relax styles. So you will earn tokens just by playing games. The future is here and cryptocurrency is it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course the regular normal reflection of 5% back to holders and merch integrated with TASTY tokens (we accept our own currency).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Don\u2019t miss the next 1000x token. I recommend you join the telegram and the discord if you want the latest news about the launch (in less than 1 hours). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHeres the info you want!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOfficial Website\n\n[https://tastytoken.co](https://tastytoken.co)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLive Whitepaper\n\n[https://www.notion.so/Tasty-Token-Live-Whitepaper-a4f1810284754870b6cc4a1e2b86a525](https://www.notion.so/Tasty-Token-Live-Whitepaper-a4f1810284754870b6cc4a1e2b86a525)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nContract\n\n0x6615Ca62dc2Bc773A4e037ff6d620CEC9a364813\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBuy V2 PancakeSwap when it launches (1 Hours)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x6615Ca62dc2Bc773A4e037ff6d620CEC9a364813](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x6615Ca62dc2Bc773A4e037ff6d620CEC9a364813)",

We are a DAO, which means holding GAIA gives you a vote in which organizations we support and the future direction of the project.

Team tokens are locked. AMA has been done and smart contracts have been submitted for audit. This isn\u2019t your average charity coin. This is a long-term project. They have taken the time to put together something that has real applications in the blockchain space.**\n\nGaiaDAO can help to offset some of the negative aspects of blockchains by actively supporting the Earth we live in, while also providing a decentralized financial platform that will benefit Gaians (hodlers of GAIA \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e).\n\n**MORE IN-DEPTH INFO:**\n\nThe[ website](https://gaiadao.org/) goes into more details on the actual tokenomics and structure of GaiaDAO.\n\nWhile you\u2019re there, feel free to check out the team page.

The value doesn't have to be in the NFTs ability to appreciate in value but instead that they hold value to the buyer themselves.\n\n \n\n18+ NFTs can be coded in really interesting ways, for example to always provide the original creator a small % of every sale of an NFT after the original sale and CumRocket is going to explore all of these possibilities to provide an amazing platform for models to build their 18+ business on.\n\nCumRocket already has deals with lots of 18+ models to produce NFTs and in fact quite a few have already been sold. Don't believe me? Check the CumRocket telegram, loads of the CumRocket Models hang out in there.

We will also be working in conjunction with our ambassadors to make custom content around helping those in need, as a way of giving back and increasing visibility of the project.\n\nWebsite: https://savethekids.io/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SaveTheKidsBSC\n\nLaunch date: June 5th @ 3PM PST / 6PM EST / 10PM GMT\n\nFor reassurance our contract will be audited and our talented developer has been doxxed on our website. \n\nTokenomics: We are excited to announce we have one of the lowest token taxes, making it affordable to buy and sell your tokens at only 3% slippage (4% for guaranteed transaction).\n- 1% Binance Charity Wallet \n- 1% Return to Holders\n- 1% To Liquidity \n\nTotal supply: 1 billion with 10% burned at launch\nCirculating supply: 900 million\n\nListing Price: TBD\n- The listing price will be about the same as the presale price. It's varying constantly with differences of about +- 1%\n\nANTI-BOT/ANTI-WHALE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM\n\n- 0.1% maximum buy limit\n\nAnyone who purchases or holds over .5% of the token supply will be subjected to the following:\n\n- They may not sell more than .1% at a time\n- They may not sell more than 20% of their supply within 24 hours\n- These restrictions are enforced by the code and they will receive errors and warnings when they try to pass the 20% supply line\n- Once a user gets below the .5% line, they will not be affected by these restrictions anymore\n\nAmbassadors (Currently Announced):\n- FaZe Kay (9M+ followers)\n- Rice Gum (18m+ followers)\n- FaZe Jarvis (12M+ followers)\n- FaZe Teeqo (7M+ followers)\n- FaZe Nikan (3M+ followers)\n\nThe team has been working extremely hard on this, and we are immensely proud of the ambassadors we have partnered with for this project. And there are more to come... \ud83d\udc40\n\n*IMPORTANT*\nTHE CONTRACT HAS NOT BEEN RELEASED. \nANYONE CLAIMING YOU CAN BUY THE COIN EARLY IS ILLEGITIMATE.\nWAIT FOR OUR CONTRACT ANNOUNCMENT ON JUNE 5TH AT 3PM PST.\n\nJoin the official telegram announcement channel at\nhttps://t.me/savethekidsofficial",

This process won\u2018t be processed manually, it will be done automatically.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks and have a wonderful hold!\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJoin the Telegram channel to learn more or ask any questions!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udcdd PROGRESS REPORT \ud83d\udcdd\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2705 Successful Presale\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2705 Day 1: steady Market Cap of $50,000+ and 50 holders\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2705 Day 2: MC jumped to $75,000 and just shy of 100 \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2705 Day 3: Current: $175,000 MC and 160 holders. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2705 Day 4: Rewards process outlined, Correction dip has occurred, EXCELLENT time to buy and hold! Market Cap under $125k \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\ude80 WHY ALPHAEX? \ud83d\ude80\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis token has set itself apart from the rest by starting out from the beginning with the goal of getting listed on major coin exchanges. With this in mind, AXC isn\u2019t your typical tokenomics where reflections are disbursed automatically to holders (this makes getting listed on Coinbase or Binance near impossible). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nInstead, AXC collects transaction fees and holds them in a rewards wallet, which will be used to distribute rewards to holders on a weekly cadence - think air drop. The first disbursement has yet to occur and there\u2019s still time to get in on the rewards!!\ud83d\udc8e\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce the plans for listing take shape, this coin will take off. It\u2019s super low current market cap still makes it easy to get in and be a part of something great from the beginning. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe team is also working hard on the next steps of the project, which includes further marketing and things such as a flex wallet and Project Excelsior - more info on this can be found on the website or in the Whitepaper. Check it out!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFlex wallet is a very interesting concept too, and while there isn\u2019t much that can be said at the moment, please note that this will play a big part in future developments at AlphaEX. Stay tuned!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese guys are very open to receive suggestions and feedback to improve and get this as far as it can. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBe part of it! Don\u2019t miss out and come join the team!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\ude80 WEEKLY REWARDS FOR TRUE HOLDERS \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udd12 LIQUIDITY LOCKED AND OWNERSHIP RENOUNCED\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2705 NO TEAM WALLETS\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udcb0TOKEN INFORMATION \ud83d\udcb0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTicker: AlphaEX\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSymbol: AXC\n\n&#x200B;\n\nContract: 0x4b82139388439d8e463f48d1781cb1eda4a9573a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTotal supply: [1.000.000.000](https://1.000.000.000) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUseful links :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPancake swap: [https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x4b82139388439d8e463f48d1781cb1eda4a9573a](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x4b82139388439d8e463f48d1781cb1eda4a9573a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite: [https://alphaex.io](https://alphaex.io) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/Alphaexofficial](https://twitter.com/Alphaexofficial) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nReddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AlphaEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlphaEX) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTG channel: [https://t.me/AlphaEXofficial](https://t.me/AlphaEXofficial)",

The same rule applies when you want to sell, please remember this. **5% slippage** is enough when buying.\n\nIf you are having issues selling on pancakeswap, please **sell on 1inch and set slippage to 50%+**, this is because pancakeswap is sometimes unable to handle the 50% fee because its max slippage is 49% which is not enough.\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 **Telegram**: [https://t.me/Token5050](https://t.me/Token5050)\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 **Website**: [https://www.5050token.net](https://www.5050token.net/)\n\n**\ud83d\udde0 Chart**:  [5050 $0.0000000696393 (5050) Price (bogged.finance)](https://charts.bogged.finance/?token=0x0530c188397CfeF801150ccD733F4ad2E809B0d6)\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Contract: **0x0530c188397CfeF801150ccD733F4ad2E809B0d6**",

    "text": "You may have seen that TSM recently announced a multimillion dollar deal with FTX and celebrated with a name change as well as a partnership. This is a huge step in the right direction for merging Esports and crypto awareness. The Esports industry is rapidly on the incline as it becomes more socially acceptable to make a living from competing on such a stage. ENCTR seems to be trying to capture that energy early on, and started a token with an entire platform being developed with a projected Q4 launch. The first launched module will be a staking module, where you'll be able to wager tokens on Esports matches, and winners get a distributed share of the prize pool. \n\nMore info from their whitepaper and website: \n\nGamers from all over the world will compete in what is named, \u201cEncountrs\u201d, decentralized gaming tournaments. There will be two types. Officially sponsored ones will be constructed with monetary backing, advertising, and partnerships so that players can compete at the highest level possible. The second type will be ones that holders of the coin can create themselves. For instance, a group of holders can decide to host their own tournament for any launch game they choose (view our website to see our official launch games). Holders will be able to use our online, multi-purpose platform to inform others of the event as well. \n\nThere are 3 types of holder roles:\n\nTeam Member\n\nStaker/Wager\n\nSpectator\n\nTeam members are holders of the token who are actually part of the tournament. They are the ones who will receive part of the prize pool for competing.\n\nStakers are regular holders of Encountr, who don\u2019t wish to participate other than to contribute to the prize pool and bet on a victor. During every match, you will be able to stake an amount of Encountr tokens to the prize pool. Stakes are either FOR or AGAINST a team or competitor. To clarify, if you stake FOR a side and they win, you get a portion of the pool. You can also stake AGAINST a side so if they lose, you get a portion as well. A holder can only choose one option, not both.\u00a0\n\nSpectators are holders of the token that don\u2019t wish to contribute their Encountr token to a prize pool but still want to view or participate during Encountrs. To holders who view the match on the Encountr platform or through 3rd party platforms via our partnerships, there will be random Encountr \u201cair drops\u201d where we randomly drop tokens just for streaming the match.\n\n(Check out the whitepaper for more information)\n\nTokenomics: 8% transaction fee. 4% reflection, 4% Liquidity (set 10-11% slippage at least)\n\n\ud83d\uddef Liquidity is locked\n\ud83d\uddefTeam says full doxx coming on platform release\n\ud83d\uddef they've already been shouted out by various large influencers, showing good reputation \n\ud83d\uddef no pre-sale, very early stealth launch\n\nthe website: https://encountr.app\n\nAll links you can find on there ^",

    "title": "$GHT Will be doing their FIRST AMA tonight at 5pm PST",
    "text": "\n\n# Project Details\n\nGHT is a custom-tailored token that pushes Diamond Hands to the next  level and was founded on the idea of holding a cryptocurrency over a  long term. The liquidity fee starts at 50% and drops by .25% every day  until it reaches 0%. This fee structure locks in buyers and nearly  guarantees exponential growth!\n\n## Fees:\n\n1. .5% - Burn\n2. .5% - Promotional Wallet\n3. 1% - Developer Wallet\n4. 3% - Base Liquidity Fee\n5. 50% - Liquidity fee that decreases by .25% until its gone\n\n## Why would anyone create such a gut wrenching token?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* We eat trading Bots for breakfast. Bots are a massive issue in crypto space, and trying to find a way to control them from moving in and out of any token is extremely difficult, so how do we manage this?  Our high tax for selling forces you to raise your slippage to a rate  that is not allowed on exchanges, literally locking the bots money into  our liquidity, yes this means you too......but don't worry the lowering  rate means you will be able to sell within 50 days of the project  starting. If the project takes off and liquidity goes up you can cash  out sooner.\n* Due to the high tax rate and the max slippage being 49% on  Pancakeswap's app and website, coin owners will be unable to sell GHT on that platform until the rate gets below 49%. If you REALLY understand what slippage is then you will know what we mean. If you don\u2019t, we  recommend you take a look at the website to better understand how slippage, liquidity pools, and liquidity fees  are actually used. We are using the system to our advantage to guarantee  big returns! We are NOT a carbon copy of other tokens (we actually know how contracts work, some other coins claim slippage is needed for the  amount of network traffic\u2026.)!\n* Built in Whale dump protections! Other contracts prevent Whales from  dumping by limiting the number of tokens that can be sold at one time\u2026\u2026just a bunch of amateurs copying each other\u2019s tokens. We take advantage of the mathematics and predictable price movement behind the  liquidity pool to truly prevent Whales from dumping on us.\n* Liquidity pool, liquidity pool, and \u2026 liquidity pool. This and only this drives the price of all tokens. This is why you see HUGE price movements when a token is released that tapers off over time as the  liquidity pool grows. We know this, we understand this, and we will use  this to our advantage to drive BIG RETURNS!\n\n# Phase 1: Deployment (Done)\n\nGraphene Hands will be launched, monitored, and stabilized by the development team for the first portion of its life. Once basic stability, adoption, and ubiquity have been achieved, the development  team will release the control to the world..........\n\n# Phase 2: Community Control\n\nWith the risk of hyperinflation threatening the value of currencies across the world, we are all bystanders in a monetary system controlled by centralized governments. In the theme of decentralized exchanges, we  are introducing a fully democratized currency controlled by the people  for the people. Every time the government raises rates and crashes the  markets or lowers rates and inflates real estate we have little to no  control over the impacts across the world. This changes with Graphene  Hands.\n\nDevelopers will democratize the various aspects of the fees, burn  and liquidity associated with GHT. Holders of GHT will make the decisions on the monetary policies backing the token. This will allow  holders to drive the liquidity, stability, and value of the token. What  would happen to a currency that is fully managed by the people, join us  on this global social experiment....\n\n# Phase 3: Project Agora\n\nThrough phase 1 and 2 the development team will be diligently working to implement what we are calling \"Project Agora\". The scope and global impact will reach full strength as we bring \"Project Agora\" to the  forefront. This modern day digital Agora built on a secure blockchain is a concept we are very excited to introduce!\n\nReddit: r/GrapheneHandsToken\n\nWebsite: https://graphenehands.com/\n\nGit: https://github.com/Graphenehandstoken/GrapheneHandsContract\n\nLP Lock: https://cryptexlock.me/pair/0xe662bEEA81C2Fe7752D51589B920F91bD4741Cc6\n\nGraph: https://dex.guru/token/0xb45acd66a027a52efad32380d41b43aba8b7e4dc-bsc\n\nContract: 0xb45acD66a027A52eFaD32380D41B43Aba8b7E4DC\n\n\n\nStats (as of posting):\n\nPrice: $0.000000142550\n\n24h Volume: $1,431\n\nLiquidity: $46,348",

Skyborn is now fully audited by TechRate and trackable in Coinbase, CoinStats, and TrustWallet apps. \n\n\ud83d\udcab SkyBorn's social outreach is also growing and it is undoubtable that this is going far given the community behind it, many of whom built SafeMoon into what it has become! The devs and the community have been working overtime to scale up this project big time. It began as simply an idea and has grown into a dedicated community of hard working individuals looking to make a mark in the crypto-space by creating a community by the holders for the holders.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f SkyBorn is a decentralized token that runs on the Binance Smart Chain. SkyBorn offers two main utilities including burn and redistribution as incentives for its holders, each at 4% per transaction. SkyBorn is designed for the community, by the community, to engage and have fun with one another.\n\nTokenomics: Total Supply: 1 Trillion Presale price (min 0.1, max 1): 1 bnb = 13.5 Billion. Pancakeswap listing price: 1 bnb = 11 Billion. Liquidity Lock: 3 months Initially burned: 29%\n\n4% Burn 4% Redistribution to all SkyBorn token holders\n\nAs a team, they\u2019ve branded themselves in such a way that endless opportunities can be created. With the individuals we have and their field of expertise, together, we will all fly to the sky and beyond! They believe that the community they create depends on the positive actions of all of us.

    "text": "**What is QuickBounty?**\n\nQuickBounty is a new kind of token experiment, thought out to have similar pumpdamentals to SafeMoon, but with a few twists\n\n**Why create this?**\n\nRight after SafeMoon was launched, a whole harem of different safemoon forks spawned. They have been plaguing the ecosystem, with \"devs\" that:\n\n1. Don't know shit about economy\n2. They probably asked for someone else to fork\n3. Have no utility in their token whatsoever\n4. Haven't touched solidity in their life and never will\n5. Fail to advance their platform in any kind of way other than \"charity\" which is basically stealing people\u2019s funds to donate with them.\n\n**Buying**\n\nThe token hasn't been released yet, it's currently being developed. We expect it to be fully tested by next week. We'll open source the code and share it with the community before we launch!\n\n**Selling**\n\nWhen a person sells QuickBounty, they get taxed. This tax is based on the amount of days the person has held the token. As days go by, the tax is reduced. Any fee collected from \ud83e\uddfb\u270bsellers goes to the \"bounty\" contract, explained below:\n\n**The bounty**\n\nYou will be able to earn BNB straight from the bounty. There will be two ways to earn money from the bounty:\n\n1. Whenever someone buys, they have a chance to take a % of the bounty.\n2. Staking will be the main way to get back from the \ud83e\uddfb\u270b bitches. Staking QuickBounty will make you earn more QuickBounty! The APY will depend on how much is in the bounty and how much you are staking\n\n**Useful links:**\n\nThey just uploaded a 15-page whitepaper that goes over their 6-month marketing strategy, their roadmap, the tokenomics, and their funding. It's SERIOUS.\n\nWebsite: [http://quickbounty.money/](http://quickbounty.money/)\n\nTg: [https://t.me/quickbounty](https://t.me/quickbounty)",

    "text": " Hello there everyone! I'm here with a unique project that's still in its very early days!\n\n**What is \"TheCryptoBricks\"?**\n\nTheCryptoBricks and its token, $BRICK, aim to create a project to build a BSC game which will be the blockchain successor to [r/Place](https://www.reddit.com/r/Place/). Some of you may know the original [r/Place](https://www.reddit.com/r/Place/) project where users were able to place a pixel on an online canvas and colour it every 10 minutes. Online communities massively rallied from all around the Internet to draw their emblems and various memes on it, at the end creating an amazing finished canvas!\n\nAs of right now, only an archive of Place is available where you can see the final canvas (google \"Place Pixel\"). As you can see there it isn't active anymore. It's because [r/Place](https://www.reddit.com/r/Place/) ended on April 2017. Today, such a canvas would certainly look completely different, just imagine the different amount of communities battling to get there own part of the canvas!\n\n**How will \"TheCryptoBricks\" work?**\n\nThe Crypto Bricks will aim to create #TheCryptoWall, a special smart contract where users lock their $BRICK into. It's a blockchain successor to the original Place. This time around, it's not about placing pixels on a canvas, but it's about placing BRICKS that you can colour as well (technically the same). The concept is that each pixel on the website is actually backed by a BEP-20 Token on the Binance Smart Chain.\n\nBut there is a twist, what's actually crazy is that every $BRICK must be placed on top of another one (expect for the bottom ones as explained on the website). This means that if someone unlocks their $BRICK from TheCryptoWall, all the BRICKs on top of it will fall, potentially ruining drawings. Can you imagine the craziness if internet communities, crypto communities, memes creators would rally onto TheCryptoWall and fight against each other ? This is a HUGE market and such a project will give a huge incentive for communities to hold onto their $BRICK, or risk their part of the canvas falling apart!\n\nThe token itself is growing at a steady pace, slowly gaining holders at a healthy pace. Liquidity is locked away and all the dev wallet/ tokenomics are explained clearly on the website/socials. The project went live with the token on the 12/05/21, so it has not even been a month since its launch! I will provide the main socials below, and if you have any questions feel free to join the group and ask as the dev is active and ready to answer questions!\n\n**Social media**\n\n* Official Telegram Discussion : [https://t.me/joinchat/TKS3x\\_gmzS04OGJh](https://t.me/joinchat/TKS3x_gmzS04OGJh)\n* Website : [https://thecryptobricks.com](https://thecryptobricks.com/)",

    "text": "Hi Everybody. I'm part of the Community of PEPE and I wanted to provide some information. Maybe you are also into it?\n\nWhat is this Project about?\n\nThe project was started by ordinary people like you and me. They have also invested in various projects before, but there was often a pump and dump, which caused them to lose the value of their investments. \n\nSo they thought, why not create a token by themselves, which is managed by the community and is getting promoted the best way possible? You can think of it this way: If a person makes a suggestion, e.g. to update the logo or to get listed on a certain exchange or change the utilization purpose, then this is getting executed by the admin team. Effectively, it is not the team that determines the progress and the path the token takes, but the members of the group. Major changes will be decided by democracy voting in the groupchat. \n\nMarketing\n\nApplications to Exchanges and Listings \ud83d\udd8a\n\n\u25cf     CoinGecko\n\u25cf    CoinMarketCap\n\u25cf    Bogged Finance\n\u25cf     WhiteBit\n\nStart of Marketing \ud83c\udfaf\n\nYoutube\n\n\u25cf     Third Party Presentations\n\u25cf     Mentions in Topic-based videos\n\u25cf     Own YT-Channel + Partnering up with Streamers\n\nSocial Media\n\n\u25cf     Create Memes for all Platforms\n\u25cf     Tiktok Viral Videos + HashTag\n\u25cf     Top 5 on multiple Subreddits\n\u25cf     Comment section on Reddit\nAdvertisement\n\u25cf     Poocoin\n\u25cf     CoinGecko\n\u25cf     BoggedFinance\n\u25cf     YouTube Ads\n\nTokenomics\n\nThere is a 6% transaction fee for each transaction.\n\n2% goes to all holders through reflection.\n2% burn, so every transaction leads to rising the pricefloor.\n2% is transferred to the LP via AutoLock to guarantee a constantly rising price floor.

The community is growing rapidly and everyone is having fun in the telegram off the back of Elons Tweets, were they actually about Squirt Rocket all along? \n\nWhat makes us special?\nSquirtRocket is a token that operates on the Binance Smart Chain. \n\nSquirt Rocket will become an adult NFT store, where you can purchase NFTs with your $Squirties tokens. The first collect is the 'Founder Collection Worldwide' featuring 9 beautiful girls from around the world on 8 exclusive NFT cards.\n\nWe have a total supply of 100 million $SQUIRTIES, with 10% of the supply burned before the presale. The devs hold no tokens at all, and they have locked the liquidity for 1 year. \n\nThe Pancakeswap Public listing will be at 3pm EST, 7pm UTC, 10pm BST.\n\nThe contract will be renounced once the presale is finalised. \n\nThere is lots of marketing planned, the community are really coming together to push this token and have already got the token listed on Coinsniper. That is how good the community are. There are ZERO bots in the telegram group, it's actually 600+ real people and supporters of Squirt Rocket.\n\nWe have all seen what CumRocket has done, and there is more than enough space in the crypto world for more adult projects. Off the back of the Elon Tweet (Which we know wasnt REALLY about Squirt Rocket) it has helped pump this project. They are a good team as they have taken advantage of that tweet which was made just a few days after they telegram started. \n\nWebsite - https://squirtrocket.finance \n\nTelegram - https://t.me/SRocketFinance",

    "title": "\ud83c\udfa8BEVO Digital Art Token, just reached 2500 Holders! Huge giveaways coming soon!",
    "text": " \u23e9Quick Recap on BEVO: BEVO is a community built NFT (Non-Fungible Token) project that was initially started by artists for artists. Their goal is to be the first NFT art token on the Binance Smart Chain to be backed by real, tangible art projects. They initially launched on May 22nd with massive support from their strong community. The token has seen massive, unprecedented growth and support since its launch and this is due in no small part to the dedication and perseverance of the developer team. The road ahead is still long, however this is not a bad thing, the developers have many goals for the project and with the way things have been going it is difficult to doubt them.\n\n\ud83c\udfa8BEVO {BE-VO} is a community built NFT token with a goal to become the most prominent force in the NFT space on the Binance Smart Chain. Created by artists themselves, they want to be the first token to be back by physical art pieces. They are recruiting artists with small platforms to aid them in converting their physical art into Non-Fungible Tokens. A great idea coupled with an extremely dedicated and hard work developer team is a recipe for success as I am sure you all know, and it is clear that the team over at BEVO has these qualities in spades.\n\n\ud83c\udfa8The art gallery aims to feature paintings, sculptures, photos and other various artworks in digital form. Each one of these art pieces will have a unique NFT attributed to it (they will all be minted on the BSC). Opening up the door to an easy, low fee way to trade any form of art, not only digital NFTs.\n\n\ud83c\udfa8The dedicated team over at BEVO has worked tirelessly over the last few months to bring the coin to pancake swap for the public to invest. Not sold on their dedication? BEVO was listed on CoinGecko just 23 hours after its initial release. Find BEVO on CoinGecko at: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bevo-digital-art-token]\n\n\ud83c\udfa8The BEVO dAPP will be home to the BEVO Art Gallery. The first art-trading platform in the world to offer asset-bound NFTs that are completely transferrable. That would also make us the first decentralized asset marketplace operating on blockchain technology, period.\n\n\ud83c\udfa8Bevo is tokenizing traditional art. Artists will be able to tokenize their work through our dAPP which creates digital NFTs that represent their art. These NFTs also constitute the actual value of the physical artform. This enables a way to buy, sell or trade real works of art through the BEVO Art Gallery using BEVO Tokens.\n\n\ud83c\udfa8The BEVO Art Gallery will feature artwork from cultures around the world, allowing every region to showcase their talent and be recognized.\n\n\ud83c\udfa8The BEVO Token will provide a new way for casual investors to invest in and support the arts. Pieces purchased from the BEVO Art Gallery will contain a scannable QR code. These codes represent the Non-fungible token [NFT] address.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 LINKS:\n\n\u2705 [VERIFIED CONTRACT] bscscan.com/address/0xc6Cb12df4520B7Bf83f64C79c585b8462e18B6Aa\n\n\ud83d\udcc4 [TOKEN ADDRESS] bscscan.com/token/0xc6Cb12df4520B7Bf83f64C79c585b8462e18B6Aa\n\n\ud83e\udd5e [PANCAKESWAP] exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swapoutputCurrency=0xc6cb12df4520b7bf83f64c79c585b8462e18b6aa\n(Slippage 8%) LIVE NOW\n\n\ud83d\udd12**[7-Year Locked Liquidity]** dxsale.app/app/pages/dxlockview?id=1839&add=0&type=lpdefi&chain=BSC\n\n\ud83d\udd12 [Exchange Listing LOCKER] dxsale.app/app/pages/dxlockview?id=0&add=0x853765d61ae39c332Bd8269b0A0d78ab2f38bDa3&type=tokenlock&chain=BSC\n\n\ud83d\udd12 [Manual Burn 2 LOCKER] dxsale.app/app/pages/dxlockview?id=1&add=0x853765d61ae39c332Bd8269b0A0d78ab2f38bDa3&type=tokenlock&chain=BSC\n\n\ud83d\udccc Quick Links:\n\n\ud83c\udf0d [Website] bevodigital.art/\n\n\ud83d\udde3 [Telegram] t.me/joinchat/kk0jLLTvvdNjMDQx\n\n\ud83d\udc26 [Twitter] twitter.com/bevotoken\n\n\ud83e\udd16 [Discord] discord.gg/XPpG9FN5Ku\n\n\ud83d\udce2We\u2019re going to be the first token in the world to be backed by tangible assets.

    "title": "CHINU - Chubby Inu (the anti-scam token)",
    "text": "**Chubby Inu** seems to have adopted the brand of the *anti-scam token*...but there is so much going on in this project:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* listed on **CMC** and **CG** about a week ago\n* liquidity is **locked**\n* live on Bilaxy\n* mcap **\\~$2.5M** (half of what it says on dextools due to inception burn)\n* less than 3 weeks old\n* **unique original contract**, not another copy cat like so many others\n* perfect tokensniffer score\n* about 1100 holders\n\nThis is not just another dog token with no utility case. The devs for **CHINU** are hard at work building an **anti-scam, staking-driven utility app** which will help with detecting scams early on so that you won't get dunked on. Their prime goal is to make sure your money is secure. How? Well the devs have already thought about some things and taken associated precautions:\n\n* **locked liquidity for 3 months (until the transition to Uniswap V3 for better dividends to holders)**\n* **adaptive contract with frequent blacklisting of bot addresses (even bot honeypots)**\n* **tokenomics that constantly add to the liquidity pool as a built in defense for large selloffs.**\n\nDid you look at the dextools page and get worried that all sales are from one or two addresses? Do they end with Aa26 and 488d? These are not bots but a part of the unique contract of CHINU. the Aa26 address is the 1inch router address and the 488d address is the Uniswap router address. The contract uses new solidity RFI mechanics as well as multiswaps and all sells are routed through these addresses and redistributed in the following ways:\n\n**\u2705** **4% back to holders (ARF)      \u2705** **3% to a charity wallet        \u2705** **3% to the liquidity pool.**\n\nThat's a **10% tax on sells**. This not only encourages holders to hold on to **CHINU**, but also works as an insulating effect against large sells (to a degree) alongside higher multiswap gas on sells. This shows that the devs have considered how to protect holders' value and want to make this a legitimate and stable project. With various developments on the horizon like The Kennel app to help spot scams, CHINU has a future that will transcend what it means to be a mascot token and will turn into a useful long-held token with substantially profitable utility.\n\n**So here's why I think this token will explode in value once people get their eyes on it:**\n\nChubby Inu's contract is designed in an intelligent way that protects value when volume is low by taxing sellers and rewarding holders, and takes advantage of higher volume periods to add to liquidity for protection from any future instability.\n\nChubby Inu has a dedicated community with active, adaptable devs and members willing to contribute both creatively and economically to ensure the stability and long-term value of the project. You can see this in the remarkable level of art, music, and other media production, far above what similar marketcap tokens are turning out.\n\nChubby Inu's marketcap is incredibly low compared to comparable projects, meaning that a realization of similar value would drive up the price substantially from where it is currently. The charts prove how ironhanded the holders apparently are when it was pumping recently against BTC and ETH testing low levels.\n\nEven in a bear market, Chubby Inu will continue to provide value to holders when they release the proprietary opportunistic multichain staking app and contract auditing service for staked holders, ensuring that even when scams are at an all time high, you will be able to buy into projects across ERC, BSC, and FTM that have been awarded a passing grade, allowing holders of Chubby Inu to thrive in both bull and bear markets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Buy it here:** [https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x910985ffa7101bf5801dd2e91555c465efd9aab3&use=V2](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x910985ffa7101bf5801dd2e91555c465efd9aab3&use=V2)\n* **ERC20 contract:** 0x910985ffa7101bf5801dd2e91555c465efd9aab3\n* **CMC:** [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chubby-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chubby-inu/)\n* **CG:** [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/chubby-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/chubby-inu)\n* **Tokensniffer:** [https://tokensniffer.com/token/0x910985ffa7101bf5801dd2e91555c465efd9aab3](https://tokensniffer.com/token/0x910985ffa7101bf5801dd2e91555c465efd9aab3)\n* **Liquidity Locked:** [https://app.unicrypt.network/amm/uni-v2/token/0x910985Ffa7101Bf5801DD2e91555c465EFD9AAB3](https://app.unicrypt.network/amm/uni-v2/token/0x910985Ffa7101Bf5801DD2e91555c465EFD9AAB3)\n\n**Telegram:** [https://t.me/ChubbyInu](https://t.me/ChubbyInu)\n\n**Website:** [www.chubbyinu.com](http://www.chubbyinu.com/)\n\n**Twitter:** [https://twitter.com/ChubbyInu2](https://twitter.com/ChubbyInu2)",

      "I've got my chinu bags packed and I'm ready to go!",
      "I think the space could really use a token and project like this. Scams are expensive and make investing in new contracts prohibitively dangerous for anyone who doesn't know their way around Etherscan. I like this.",
      "So it looks like the app is still just a preview, but if the devs have written an original contract like tokensniffer seems to suggest, they probably have the ability to pull this off. That would be awesome utility in a small mcap token's app...might really blow up.",
      "Love this project!  Most transparent team I have interacted with.  Forget TED Talks, the weekly CHINU Talks led by Moss are amazing!",
      "I love the original contract and the redistribution. Get rich while the others leave. Does anyone know, when the kennel app will be ready?",
      "LET'S GO, BEEN HOLDING $CHINU FOR A WHILE, IT DESERVES MUCH MORE",
      "This anti scam coin is going to explode",
      "All the best",
      "great project",
      "Looking forward to this project",
      "That seems to be the focus. I can't even imagine how much my trading game would be improved if that same app had a Uniswap API to detect new contract deploys and automatically reviewed them for buy/sell pauses or other potential red flags. I could ride virtually every hype wave.",
      "In the TG, they said they just brought on another fullstack developer on top of the 3 devs that already exist. I believe they are interested in releasing this app ASAP which would be a boon for the token (and ecosystem IMO).",
      "I heard the last one. I felt like I was getting a free blockchain education on bots and smart contracts! Cool stuff, he's really passionate.",
      "Q3 was the original timeline on the roadmap, but the devs just brought at least one more full stack developer on to the team (possibly two). I think they're trying to have a faster release schedule and maybe even a little something for us before the big item. Not sure what that could be, but I'd say it's pretty clear they are concerned with providing value to holders, in both the long and short-term. Can't wait to see what sort of stuff the creators of this sophisticated of a contract can imagine and deploy as far as user blockchain instruments.",
      "I think you're right. Having utility as a mascot token is pretty rare, but having an app that helps holders make money on other projects? I feel like that's dedication to the cause beyond token tribalism."

    "text": " \n\nRage Comics were the greatest meme of all time. When they started on 4chan and began spreading to every corner of the internet, they gave us a new avenue for self-expression. An outlet for our anger, our frustration, our sadness. But also for our joy, our passion, our creativity. A way to cope and share the burden with the community. A way to celebrate and tell the world that not everything is shit, even if you felt that way, deep down.\n\nThey were easy to make, easy to share. Simply a meme for the rest of us. And that's why the stories we shared through them resonated with so many people. It was your fellow person on the internet, feeling dreadful or happy and when reading their comics you could relate. Raw emotion. Anger. Frustration. Sadness. Joy. Passion. No fake Instagram Story. No oh-so-clever Twitter Thread. No bullshit dance on TikTok.\n\nNo matter who you were, where you were, old, young, Rage Comics were for everyone.\n\n2008 was a different time. An easier time maybe. And the world around us has changed. We want to bring back the feelings Rage Comics gave us, this time in crypto.\n\nIntroducing FUU: a new coin with an old, but great idea.\n\nWe want to establish FUU as a gesture of appreciation. A tip for great memes. A heads up to someone you resonate with. A way to help someone cope with a shitty situation. A way to celebrate something great happening. Something to give back to your fellow person on the internet and to the community. Simply a coin for the rest of us.\n\n**What is Ragetoken?**\n\nThe contract: 0x82B085f724B9A822320c84233291b62C13DD0712\n\nRagetoken \\[$FUU\\] is a smart contract on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Ragetoken (v2) launched on May 25th, 2021 with a total of 2,000,000,000 tokens minted. The max supply of 10,000,000,000 tokens will be reached after a time period of 180 days as new tokens will be minted for presales, airdrops and contests.\n\nEvery token holder of Ragetoken (v1) received the same amount of Ragetoken (v2) as we launched the updated version. Ragetoken (v2) has a 3% liquidity tax on each transaction, which will be automatically provided to the Pancakeswap liquidity pool. The liquidity tokens will be locked to ensure the maximum of security. This liquidity tax can be lowered or even put to zero if enough liquidity is provided by third parties in later stages.\n\n**Dev Wallets**\n\nThere are 6 developer wallets, with 50,000,000 (0.5%) tokens each at start, with the allowance to mint another 200,000,000 (2%) tokens over a time period of 180 days. This way we can ensure that none of us will pull the rug, even if one wanted to.\n\n**Discord/Reddit Bot**\n\nWe are working on a Discord and Reddit bot which will allow users to tip/gamble/play with their FUU. Stay tuned.\n\n**You are VERY early**\n\n$FUU currently has a marketcap of around $250k on pancakeswap. Just imagine. Never forget that meme magic is real.\n\nIf you don\u2019t wanna buy on pancakeswap, you can join our telegram or discord for airdrops and presales.\n\n[Website](https://ragetoken.com/)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ragetoken)\n\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/VxEgw7G5g7)\n\n[Telegram](https://t.me/RageTokenTalk)\n\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ragetoken/)",

I believe that it is positioned to pump hard in the next bull market. The team is working hard to meet their promises. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe team announced that they are releasing Fire Capital which will be an institution that will finance crypto projects with marketing account funds. As you might know, Fire Token has a marketing fund that receives 2% of every transaction to spend in marketing initiatives. The team decided to use some of these funds to invest in other projects and share the profits with the token holders. I think this an incredible idea because most of the ShitCoins do not have utility. Fire Capital will make Fire Token a token with a great utility because it will foster the development of crypto projects and create value to its holders. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFire token is currently working on Fire Capital website where crypto projects will be posted by their developers. Then the Fire Token holders will vote in which projects they want Fire Capital to invest. Holders will also have the opportunity to vote for charities. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLadies and gentleman this is a project that gives power to the community. For example, they just did a poll for the community to choose between two charities to receive a donation of USD 10k. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAccording with the Fire Token team the profits from the Fire Capital will be used to buy Fire Token and burn Fire Token, allowing holders to profit from reflection. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am really excited to find out how the Fire Capital project is going to work out.

The value doesn't have to be in the NFTs ability to appreciate in value but instead that they hold value to the buyer themselves.\n\n18+ NFTs can be coded in really interesting ways, for example to always provide the original creator a small % of every sale of an NFT after the original sale and CumRocket is going to explore all of these possibilities to provide an amazing platform for models to build their 18+ business on.\n\nCumRocket already has deals with lots of 18+ models to produce NFTs and in fact quite a few have already been sold.

The time will be random between a minute interval and a randomizer will choose the winning time! Purchase must be within 10 seconds of the time and if there are multiple purchases at the same time, the person who received the most tokens win.\nLast One In\n15% of the prize pool would be given to the person who makes the last purchase of 0.1BNB before the rug pull occurs!\n\nAll the prize money comes from the community who purchases as 10% of every trade goes towards the prize pool so the more players the bigger it will be in the end.

The global lottery market is a $194 BILLION dollar industry!\n\n\ud83d\udc20\ud83d\udc20\ud83d\udc20\ud83d\udc20\ud83d\udc20\ud83d\udc20\ud83d\udc20\nHourly: 30,000 Tokens\nDaily: 400,000 Tokens\nWeekly: 5,000,000 Tokens\n\ud83d\udc20\ud83d\udc20\ud83d\udc20\ud83d\udc20\ud83d\udc20\ud83d\udc20\ud83d\udc20\n\nhttps://grouper.website/  Website\nhttps://t.me/GROUPER_Lottery   Telegram\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEqZy-Fi-RA  Explainer Video\nhttps://grouper.website/?page_id=2201  Grouper Swap BTC/LTC/DOGE:GROUPER\n\nWhy is it named Grouper? Because there are three lotteries grouped into one!\n\n----What is it? ----\n   The Grouper Token is a perpetual lottery token hosted on the Binance Smart Chain. There are hourly, daily, and weekly Lottery draws. The amount of Grouper tokens needed to play will be determined by the cost of the coin and overall total holders.  All you must do is have at least the minimum amount to automatically be entered into all the lotteries. *176 Lotteries A Week*\nCurrent Min Tokens to Be Entered in Lotteries: 50,000 Grouper\nBSC Contract Address: 0x9ce5222a0419cc4d25ece978aaa5d8c31b3565e6\n\n---How do I make money? ---\n1. Buy the minimums to play lottery and enjoy community\n2. Buy more, become an owner, help steer the project and eventually sell back your tokens to those trying to join at a much higher price + play all the lotteries.\n----Why is it different? ---\n   The supply of Grouper is elastic. You have deflationary pressure when Grouper is traded as there is a 6% tax on every transaction. 5% that is burned, along with the 1% advertising fee (6% total). This helps to reduce supply while also discouraging high speed bots from buying and selling around the lottery times. The Grouper contract is fully published for everyone to read unlike many other lottery tokens on the Binance Smart Chain.\n\n---How can they guarantee winners? ---  (THIS SOLVES PROBLEM 1)\n   Minting coins is not evil, as long as it is explained upfront. To ensure timely lotteries the coins are minted. Hence if transaction volume is low this might cause slight inflation. The max coins awarded per week is equal to 1.5% of the total available coins. The 5% transfer tax easily counteracts this over time.\n***Many other bsc lotteries die because their volume trails off and they cannot pay lotteries! ***\n---What the heck is GROUPER Swap? --- (SOLVES PROBLEM 2)\n   Grouper swap allows newer members to bsc to buy in directly with Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Doge coin. (more coins added soon). This allows them to skip pancake swap and all the headaches of converting to bnb and then to the GROUPER lottery token. Imagine when the Doge bois figure out they can join a lottery join FOR LIFE for 100 Doge.\n\n---Simplicity--- (SOLVES PROBLEM 3)\n   Buy, hold, and win. It is literally that simple. If your wallet holds the minimum amount you are eligible to play all 176 weekly GROUPER lotteries! The minimum amount needed will NEVER go up, only down as the market cap increases. The dev\u2019s are aiming to peg it at a $25 entry per wallet. So, if you buy more coins make sure to split them into separate wallets so you get more chances to win. (Metamask works great for this). The devs are also working on the website so you will be notified by email, telegram, and TEXT MESSAGE if you win! The weekly lottery is obviously the largest draw, but it is super fun being able to watch all the hourly winners in the chat get excited!\n---Published Contract---\nGrouper contract is fully published and the devs answer any questions about it. Please support open source and only contribute to bsc projects that fully publish their contracts!\n---What are the tokenomics? ---\n   The supply of Grouper is elastic. You have deflationary pressure when Grouper is traded as there is a 6% tax on every transaction. 5% that is burned, along with the 1% advertising fee (6% total). This helps to reduce supply while also discouraging high speed bots from buying and selling around the lottery times. The Grouper contract is fully published for everyone to read unlike many other lottery tokens on the Binance Smart Chain. The overall 5% burn results in deflationary pressure. Fair rules, published contract, and fair randomization. \n---Can you increase your odds? ---\n   If I have more Grouper does it increase my chances? No, each wallet has the same chance to win as long as they are eligible. You can split your wallet into several smaller wallets for better chances if you would like as long as they hold the minimum.\n\n---Liquidity lock? Presale? ---\n   The Grouper presale was 5/30/21 and sold out in 92 minutes. Soft cap of 50bnb and a hard cap of 100bnb. Grouper has already passed the initial presale holder dump and is primed for takeoff!\n--How do I trust GROUPER? ---\n   Functions allow you to interact directly with GROUPER on the blockchain!\nTrust but verify, all GROUPER information can be verified directly on the black chain. Examples include last winner, when the next jackpot is, and how many current holders there are.\n---Is there a roadmap? ---\n-Upcoming Mobile App\n-Expanded Website Integration\n-Influencer Affiliate Program\n-Ethereum 2 Upgrades\n\n---Are you still reading? ---\nIf you are still reading, I hope you enjoyed learning a little bit about the Grouper project. I got my bags and am waiting for takeoff. I believe the facts presented above clearly explain why Grouper will be here for the long run and outpace all the bsc and crypto lotteries.\nGrouper is not trying to be the best bsc lottery\u2026 They are trying to be the best CRYPTO lottery!!!",

Stop anyone from being able to trace your bnb funds and transactions, and provide high APY for staking participants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are mixers on other chains such as bitcoin and Ethereum, but they come at high fees and no ability for the community to stake and benefit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBscBlender set out to provide a strong mixing service to those on the Binance Smart Chain, while also providing an opportunity to those in the community who stake their $BLEND.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis works the same way mixers on other chains work by utilizing zsnarks, but with the benefit of staking rewards for community members in the mixing/staking pool, and at a fraction of the fees that occur on other chains. What differentiates BscBlender is the mechanism by which mixing occurs. The mixing pool that users make their deposits too is the same pool utilized by staking providers. The benefit to this, is an increase in the amount of deposits and withdraws from the mixing pool, which results in additional obfuscation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe smart contract accepts a standard $BLEND and $BNB deposit, along with a hashed random key that the user generates. Once deposited, the funds are \"mixed\". Mixing occurs when there are multiple deposits and withdrawals between the time a user deposits their $BNB or $BLEND and the time they withdraw. You can withdraw your funds as either $BNB or $BLEND. When it is time to withdraw, submit the key that you generated to the smart contract and a withdrawal address. The withdrawal address does not need any $BNB or $BLEND to receive the funds. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe rewards come in for the holders of the native $BLEND. Each transaction incurs a 3% transaction fee. 2% goes proportionally to the staking providers and 1% is burned forever. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udd12Tokenomics\ud83d\udd12\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTicker: $BLEND\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTotal Supply Distribution\n\n\ud83d\udd12 55% (5,500,000 tokens) \u2014 Staking / Mixing Pool\n\n\ud83d\udd12 20% (2,000,000 tokens) \u2014 Presale\n\n\ud83d\udd12 20% (2,000,000 tokens) \u2014 PancakeSwap Seed Liquidity\n\n\ud83d\udd12 5% (500,000 tokens) \u2014 Team (locked for 1 year)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udd123% Transaction tax\ud83d\udd12\n\n  \ud83d\udd122% = Staking Providers\n\n  \ud83d\udd121% = Burned Forever\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite:\n\n[https://bscblender.com/](https://bscblender.com/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMedium:\n\n[https://medium.com/@BSCBlender](https://medium.com/@BSCBlender) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nReddit:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/BscBlender/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BscBlender/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwitter:\n\n[https://twitter.com/bscblender](https://twitter.com/bscblender)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/BscBlender/BscBlender](https://github.com/BscBlender/BscBlender)",

The launch was completely stealth and completely fair, with 100% of ALL tokens being added to the liquidity pool. \n\nThe Devs are Doxxed in the Whitepaper on the website, so you know they aren't going to rug you. They also have posted videos and are planning a video AMA.\n\nTOKENOMICS:\n\n21,000,000 MAX SUPPLY. No mint, no bull.\n\nA homage to Bitcoin. The one that started all of this and allowed all of us to be here. We have come a long way since then, but we want to remember where it all started.\n\nYou need ATLEAST 21% SLIPPAGE to buy. They have 10% of all transactions going into the Liquidity Pool. \n\n8% distributed between ALL HOLDERS for big passive yields, and 2% goes into a community wallet, to be used as giveaways and promotion purposes. They currently have a meme competition!\n\nAlso had 0 Presale, so I'm feeling pretty SAFU. \n\nTake a look at the website: hyperrail.finance\n\nWhitepaper with DOXXED devs is on the site!\n\nContract:  \n0x6D4e803582d8f0DBAB32605289Ee3F480309dda9 \n\nTG: /Hyperrail\n\nTwitter: @ HyperRailCrypto (Currently temporarily restricted because Twitter are weird)  \n\n\nBeen gaining slowly and surely, with a fun community really building up. Come be a part of it and get in early before it explodes! Slow climb to 200k marketcap and we aren't stopping!\n\nThey also have a max TX amount of around 1% of the max supply to prevent such violent whale dumps. \n\nIDK, I know there's alot of coins on here, but this one is safe with the devs and they seem dedicated.\n\nNot financial advice ofcourse but I also like the name and it gives me SafeMoon vibes. Devs are doxxed so they must be in it for the long run, with marketing lined up. \n\nCheers for reading guys and good luck with your crypto shenanigans.",

    "text": "MoonRetriever, bringing a new era of safe investments to DEFI\n\nBy now it should be clear for most of us that DeFi is an environment filled with opportunistic scammers who are looking to continue on their mission of stealing peoples money.\n\nUnfortunately the majority of victims are new or inexperienced investors looking for opportunities. As it stands right now the opportunities people see for maximum or instant turnover is getting in early on new projects.\n\nAt the same time, these investors are exposed to the highest risk of getting wiped out by bots, scammed by honey-pots, rug pulls, coordinated team token dumping and a lot of other devious tactics.\n\nTo avoid this today an inventory must check multiple websites, search for vulnerabilities in code, understand tokenomics and collate all the data together in order to make a decision.\n\nThat\u2019s simply too difficult for the majority of us and is a major issue that we need to resolve before we truly can make the crypto sphere feel safe for the general public and gain mainstream adoption. Anyone who solves or helps bring new innovative solutions to this issue is in my opinion, sitting on a potential goldmine.\n\nThat\u2019s where MoonRetriever comes in.\n\n$FETCH is the operating asset of the MoonRetriever Project, the first-ever DEFI project on Binance Smart Chain that serves as a crypto risk assessment platform aiming to help people find safe investments, by bringing an array of features together,\n\n\ud83e\uddb4 **No Rug Pulls From Now On**\n\nA solid multi-featured rug-check system is in place to invest safely.\n\n\ud83e\uddb4 **Never Miss Important Transactions**\n\nTrack specific wallets and keep a close eye on burn and developer wallets. Follow your favorite wallets and copy their movements!\n\n\ud83e\uddb4 **Track All Market Movements**\n\nAlways stay up-to-date. Keep track of the market movements and chase opportunities.\n\n\ud83e\uddb4 **Secure Your Future Investments**\n\nNo more blind investments! MoonRetriever will assist you to choose the safest early-released tokens and presales as they are launched.\n\n\ud83e\uddb4 **Fetch New and Safe Projects**\n\nUpcoming ILO launchpad with automatic LP lock and Team Token lock as well as project screening to ensure the safety of our $FETCH holders.\n\n**Own $FETCH and invest safely with this good boy.**\n\nBut wait, that\u2019s not all.\n\nOn top off all of these exciting features I think it's worth noting some of the achievements and updates they've already achieved:\n\n1. They had an incredibly successful launch hitting a $20M market cap in the first few hours\n2. Despite being a few days old during one of the biggest crypto dips in a long time, they've held our community base and MC strong.\n3. Super transparent devs, they\u2019re doxxed, fully audited, Gov issued ID's and all\n4. Trended #1 on Coinhunt.cc\n5. Sneak peek of the UI/UX on their upcoming platform, looks and sounds amazing!\n6. Community is absolutely amazing, so supportive, respectful and fun.\n7. Getting real close to 13.000 holders!\n8. Super active team members - 24/7.\n\n... and so much more!\n\nThere was just announcement where they mentioned that they will be opening up their discord server (TBA when) and host an AMA - where the whole team will introduce themselves properly to the community, and let the lead devs give some updates. This is a perfect opportunity to have your questions about the project answered!\n\nThey also announced that 4 team members are doxxing themselves in the coming days as well as going through a re-branding to better fit the image of the product they want to deliver.\n\nI have zero doubts about this team and I have a feeling there\u2019s a lot juiciness coming this time ahead of us, but I\u2019ll leave you at that, check them out yourself!\n\n**Relevant links**\n\n\ud83d\udc36 [**Website**](https://moonretriever.com/)  \n\ud83d\udcac [**Telegram**](https://t.me/MoonRetriever)  \n\ud83e\udd5e [**Buy on Pancakeswap**](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x8bfc1c564E4490790DFac641C9a0FecD3f91F584)  \n\ud83d\udcac [**BSCscan**](https://bscscan.com/token/0x8bBc1712158B9ff8Eb81d54b022641bAb19a9752)  \n\ud83d\udcc8 [**Chart**](https://charts.bogged.finance/?token=0x8bfc1c564E4490790DFac641C9a0FecD3f91F584)  \n\u270b [**Ownership renounced**](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x998a08eedfac51775d8f3d70b5df7f255d0cf8e9707fabca46294cae13d1db36)  \n\ud83d\udd10 [**Locked liquidity**](https://unicrypt.network/amm/pancakev2/token/0x8bfc1c564E4490790DFac641C9a0FecD3f91F584) (make sure to connect your wallet to be able to verify it)",

    "title": "DeCloud Token - Decentralized Cloud Storage on the BSC Network Fairlaunch",
    "text": "In Crypto, we often pride ourselves on being able to trade currency in an ecosystem where our wealth is decentralized and not controlled by a big bank... However, when it comes to storage, it seems we don't have many options for a decentralized platform to store our files safely and affordably, without having to worry about somebody being able to access them both without our knowing, nor our permission.  This is how we came to be. We are the Decentralized Cloud Storage token with the ambition to build an ecosystem where token holders will be able to use such a service without wondering if the Big Tech storage will have access to your pictures, information, and other files.   \n\n\nHow it works: Decentralized Cloud Storage is far simpler than it sounds, basically, files are split up into many different pieces, and split between multiple data centers. When you want to retrieve your file, all the different pieces pull together from each data center to build the full hash of your file.   \n\n\nThink of it this way, when you download a .RAR file, sometimes you have to download it in parts to build it all together. Same concept here, just in different cloud storage units around the world rather than from one folder.    \n\n\nTG: https://t.me/DeCloudToken Contract Verified: https://bscscan.com/token/0x50F0A7D9144F50BA9F8732Fbc5E71131c2138a61   \n\n\n100% of Liquidity will be locked upon release of the token.    \n\n\nOur Tokenomics:  \n\ud83e\uddfe 15% Tax (Described Below)    \n\ud83d\udd25 5% Burned (Gone Forever)    \n\ud83d\udd19 5% Reflection (Yield-Generation. The more you hold, the more you're rewarded by paperhands)    \n\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb 4% Professional Developer Hiring Costs/Data Center Fund (For our Q3 PC, Android, & iOS apps & Secure Data Center Costs)  \n\n\nSomething to note: We will never sell off a massive amount of liquidity all at once, it will be small amounts during uptrends to avoid indirectly causing an impactful crash in the market cap.   \n\n\nWe will also inform the community VIA Telegram when small sales are happening to avoid unnecessary panic.  \ud83d\ude80 1% Marketing (Poocoin ads, Coinhunt ads, Tik Tok Marketing, Twitter Partnerships & more...)   We know what you're thinking, the taxes are so high!   \n\n\nWell, the purpose of this token is to bring more utility to the crypto space. As a mid to long-term investment, this is your best option to get in early. We're not some SafeDoge or MoonPoo, we actually have something to offer you. We encourage you to HODL.  After the Product Launch, tokens will be utilized to pay for the decentralized cloud storage through our upcoming app and other services through the website.   \n\n\nThese tokens will also be burned in order to further increase the value of the remaining pool of tokens amongst HODL'ers    \n\n\nRoadmap:    \nQ2: \ud83d\udea7 \ud83d\udcac    \n\\- Website Launch (Coming within the week, before token release)    \n\\- Budgeting Plan for hiring an experienced developer  - Token Launch    \n\\- CMC & CGK Listing, Coinhunt, Poocoin, other marketing throughout popular crypto social medias    \n\\- AMA (Post-Launch, Week 1)   \n\n\nQ3: \ud83d\udcb1 \ud83d\udcf1    \nExchange Listings (Whitebit & Hotbit first, more to follow pending presumed success of the token)  Official LLC/Company Application & Listing  Proxy/RDP Rental through our web portal (Early Q3)  Beta App Launch for Decentralized Cloud Storage App (more details in the future...)  Official Launch (Mid-Late Q3)    \n\n\nQ4 - Q1 2022: \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83e\udd1d\u200d\ud83e\uddd1    \n\\- Build more decentralized applets & more..    \n\n\nI hope this is something that may interest you all.

Why would I have a reason to lie? There\u2019s nothing in it for me. Last but not least, token breakdown for all you technical nerds:\n\n* BEP-20 token WITHOUT deflation, ZERO burn. It don\u2019t need shitcoin characteristics to artificially drive up prices when the value it provides is so clear.\n* 1T supply, but trust me, this is nothing compared to all the other rugpulls and honeypots.\n* 10,000MC on listing, just listed so get in while you can. No pump and dump, tokens are all in locked developer wallets! Or you can be the one that pumps and dumps, who cares either way.  \n\n\nLinks for you to do what your heart is telling you to do:  \n**Site**: [www.loganwin.com](http://www.loganwin.com/)  \n**Telegram**: t.me/lgnwn  \n**BSC Scan**: [https://bscscan.com/token/0x6249ddc70aff79243534c08aad47bd73abd3fe4a](https://bscscan.com/token/0x6249ddc70aff79243534c08aad47bd73abd3fe4a)  \n**PCS**: [https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x6249ddc70aff79243534c08aad47bd73abd3fe4a](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x6249ddc70aff79243534c08aad47bd73abd3fe4a)\n\n  \nGet in on the Logan Win train now! #loganwin",

It will be huge.\n\nI we all despise Anti-Semitism, but we all like money and humor and if that token makes its way into mainstream media (one way or another) you can expect nice returns.\n\nOn their website, you can read that they will perform a lot of activities within a period of time after launch to keep the token valid and stimulate the price.\n\nPresale via DxSale\n\n1% of Tokens burnt on every transaction\n\n1% tax redistributed back to holders\n\n4% tax locked back into liquidity pool",

GLend holders earn rewards through transaction fees and inflation that are directly distributed and reflected on the holders balances.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **The presale will take place the 6th of June on Unilock and the hardcap will be 980BNB which will give a marketcap of $ 350K USD to the listing which will make GLend** ***a real GEM.

Indie devs don't make a lot of money, and this project could go a long way in stretching their development dollars, while laying the groundwork for more unique games. \n\n**If that's good enough for you,** [**click here**](https://dogira.net/) **to check out the project (gas is also REALLY cheap this week so don't dawdle).**\n\nOtherwise, keep reading to learn more specifics about what the project is up to. Dogira\u2019s objective is to:\n\n\\-Help developers build their games, while enabling them to implement unique systems only possible with the blockchain. They would mainly target Indie devs (a usually untapped market in the crypto sphere)\n\n\\-Widely implement utility-based NFTs: Loot, unlockables (DLC, exclusive content, etc.), characters gained from NFT ownership, ANYTHING in-game or out. This is a coin with a goal, not just your average dog token.\n\n\\-We didn't send coins to Vitalik to \u201cburn our tokens.\u201d The Dogira team launched a hugely successful donation campaign with Viralata (REAU) and have already raised $50,000 in just three days (this is one of the BIGGEST donation campaigns in crypto history!).\n\nOfficial token chats have a history of being toxic, and complete chaos\u2026 Even slow mode can\u2019t contain the nonsense. Dogira has 13,000 members in the telegram chat every day, and it manages to feel like a community, so you can jump into the conversation, get to know the wonderful people inside, and create genuine relationships with like-minded holders.\n\nDogira will be at the forefront of the blockchain gaming revolution with practical, well-built utility.

The $JIZZ token will trade 1:1 with the custom build $DIGITAL Cryptocurrency, a decentralized proof-of-stake governance token that gives holders legal ownership over a proportion of the platform they Create Content for. \n\nThis model in essence turns Content Creators into shareholders with all the legal rights and protections afforded to the shareholders of a Limited Liability Company, whithout the company needing to be publicly traded on an exchange. In addition, as both the $JIZZ token and in-development $DIGITAL Cryptocurrency are freely tradeable on the Binance Smart Chain (with $DIGITAL scheduled to be launched as a wrapped coin) shares and ownership over the platform are freely transferable and easily liquidated if required.\n\nThe JIZZ.DIGITAL platform does not aim to be a competetor to CumRocket, OnlyFans, or MindGeek - It aims to redefine the relationship between online Content Creators and their respective platforms.\n\nAfter the launch of the JIZZ.DIGITAL platform, the team at Luxury Fully Automated Space Communism LTD aim to create a Safe-For-Work bitchute-like platform, also governed by the $DIGITAL governance token.\nHolders are able to propose votes that become binding resolutions of the platforms they create content on by staking their $DIGITAL in a voting pool.\n \nAt the team continue to develop the project, governence features will be added to increase the control content creators have over their platforms until the automated system permits the team to completely renounce ownership over the platform, creating the first decentralized governance structure of a not-for-profit company utilizing the blockchain.\nCharity Excecutives take hundred thousand dollar bonuses each year and earn 6 figure salaries for what untimately amounts to an entirely expendable position.  Let's cut out the middle man. Five companies control over 80% of the content we see and create online and we don't get a vote on how they're run.

    "text": "As an investor you are always on the lookout for the next big cryptocurrency to buy, that is likely to explode and make you filthy rich. You read all these rags to riches stories, and you absolutely do not want to have crypto FOMO. However, hidden behind few hundred folks who have made fortune, are stories of thousands or millions who have lost money in many crypto scams. As an investor, you need to be able to spot and avoid these scam cryptocurrencies. This is even more important for new tokens, which are marketed heavily and being penny tokens have low barrier to investment. Eventually many of them will get rugpulled or dumped.\n\nTo find early yet promising projects, you need to do through analysis and research of token fundamentals. There is simply obscene number of tokens being released every day and it becomes exceedingly difficult to get all the information that you need to look at before buying. As a result, you end up relying on the partial information shared by the developers (devs) in their marketing posts or manipulated comments on reddit. The result, you become the victim of pump and dump cryptocurrency scams.\n\nPlease read this excellent [research article](https://mudra.website/docs/research.html) which outlines a way to check token fundamentals before buying. Not only a investment research strategy is outlined but the associated tool makes execution of the strategy viable with no effort on investors part.",

The 8 devs are UK-based and have a very clean website and social media portfolio. The provisional whitepaper is up on our website and they are applying for an audit.

Make weekly charity donations based off a community vote\n3. Have a lottery with all the holders The final goal of the coin is to reach a 1m market cap and to pave the way for an NFT marketplace for content creators.

On top of this, wildlife numbers are plummeting.\n\nWe need to adapt to climate change, regenerate our land and restore our rivers. But how?\n\nOne fast way is to slow the flow in the rivers and streams that crisscross our river catchments. We can do some of this with engineering \u2013 but it is expensive. We can also look to natural solutions and this is where beavers can help.\n\nBeavers build a series of dams that filter out pollutants, reduce flooding, store water in pools for times of drought, and attract a huge host of other wildlife.\n\nBeavers are an ally providing ecosystem engineering and act as a totem for reconnecting people with the rest of nature, helping us create nature recovery networks along our rivers.\n\nFor this reason, we from BeaverFever would like to help the beavers and donate to people actively helping the beavers all over the world.\n\n**Just Launched**\n\nAre you ready to build a dam to the moon?\n\n\\- 100x Potential\n\n\\- 100% LP Burned\n\n\\- Ownership Renounced\n\n\\- Long Term Vision With A Super Low Market Cap\n\n\\- Community events\n\n\\- Helping conservation of beavers around the world\n\n**Tokenomics**\n\nToken supply: 1,000,000,000,000,000 BF\n\n5% tax redistributed to holders\n\n5% added to LP each transaction\n\nWe've taken these steps to encourage users to HOLD no matter what.\n\nBuy on PancakeSwap (make sure your slippage is at least 15%): [https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x1f644edbf28685ca0d35f9cd64c6f2c95b3c5f08](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x1f644edbf28685ca0d35f9cd64c6f2c95b3c5f08)\n\nTelegram:[ https://t.me/beaverfevertoken](https://t.me/beaverfevertoken)\n\nWebsite:[ https://beaverfever.online/](https://beaverfever.online/)",

That's why as a true community token, it is asked that only Bulls invest. A token designed for Bulls! Paper hands are not welcome, although it is impossible to avoid them.\n\nSo what makes this different? Why should you invest? \n\nIf we can create a token that only crypto Bulls invest in, I believe it can be a success. Mix that in with high yield tokenomics (7% redistribution to holders) to discourage selling, and a promising road map and I believe we have a winner here. The team is small yet hard working. They have been working on social media promotions, improving the website, getting onto CoinGecko and cmc is next. There are also promises of more in the works, but one thing I like is they aren't promising lots of unachievable things.\n\nChallenges to overcome:\n\nAs an actual community token the team is well aware there are a lot of challenges ahead, but they are very open. The main struggle now is growth and traction, in a world with lots of memecoins it is hard to stand out. But as a community we are slowly gaining day by day. \n\nThe next challenge is being unique and developing $FTB purpose. The main use case is a store of value, but the team are also working hard to create other solutions to make FTB stand out. I believe it will be different from other coins who just promise an exchange or a wallet. \n\nThere is also HUGE potential! The token is only 1 week old and 180k market cap.\n\nI believe this token has potential but of course DYOR before investing.

    "text": "**Released April 21, 2021. Dogey-Inu has an active team that is marketing, answering questions, and creating an atmosphere for growth.** \n\n**Lock!**\n\n**$DINU** features a liquidity lock through Unicrypt that does not become available until the year 2100. This helps create a worry-free environment in the community and reduces the ability for any one-party to damage the ecosystem dramatically. \n\n**Burn!**\n\nAnother feature of **$DINU** includes a supply burn of 60% sent directly to Vitalik upon creation. This reduces available supply, allows transacting with fewer decimal places, and further helps reduce the ability for any one party to hurt the ecosystem. Initially, when VB decided to donate $SHIB supply for charity; many were worried. This proved to be extremely valuable in terms of the community as it helped solidify their position in the world. Now featured on every major media station in the world because of Vitalik\u2019s actions. We hope that one day we can prove this type of value to the world. \n\n**Goals**\n\nAs mentioned in the title we are just over one month old. The team does not pay for any type of promotion or volume boosting as many, many other tokens are currently. The community is strictly focused on organic, natural growth. This will reduce the \u201cpump and dump\u201d style of chart often seen with other Inus. Although currently just a simple \u201cmeme\u201d token, Dogey-Inu hopes to contribute to the cryptoworld far more than just a simple copy/paste swap, or other gimmicks that many other Inus rely on. Products aren't promised to pump price, when we release our official whitepaper and dapp when it is finished and cleared by the auditor, then we would feel comfortable announcing a product. Our ultimate goal is to onboard \u201cno-coiners\u201d into the cryptosphere. Creating an atmosphere to help those new to crypto and harbor mass adoption.\n\n**Other Info**\n\nWe are listed and verified on nearly every token list except for Coin Gecko thus far. Airdrops of **$DINU** were given to the top 1000 $SHIB wallets, as a way to show appreciation for the effect that project and their tokenomics have had on the community. They are at the forefront of mass adoption among no-coiners and meme tokens on Ethereum. \n\n$DINU\u2019s only liquidity pools include Uniswap v2/v3.

    "text": "\u2618\ufe0f Dia duit a chairde agus f\u00e1ilte go LEPRACOIN \u2013 Hello friends and welcome to LEPRACOIN\n\n\u2618\ufe0fLEPRACOIN just launched on BSC folks, absolute gem.\n\nAmazing dedicated dev and team, not just another pump and dump. The dev and team actually has big plans with this.\n\n\u2618\ufe0f Buy (9-10% slippage): https://exchange.pancakeswap. finance/#/swap?inputCurrency=0xcA71DdB30ddC906048bcec5dF305683F289C8C40\n\n\u2618\ufe0f Contract: 0xcA71DdB30ddC906048bcec5dF305683F289C8C40\n\nAnnouncement just happened today (3 days after launch) \u2013 the project is introducing something completely unique \u2013 the concept of cycles:\n\n\u2618\ufe0f Growth\n\n\u2618\ufe0f Burn\n\n\u2618\ufe0f Rewards\n\n\u2618\ufe0f Charity\n\nTokenomics Cycles:\n\nAs the LEPRACOIN token and project progresses, the needs of holders, and the movement of the coin demands something more fluid in terms of tokenomics. The transaction fee is 8%, but each cycle will have different tokenomics in how that fee is distributed, designed for maximum growth potential. Each cycle last for 1 week initially, increasing to monthly cycles after that.\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown of each cycle:\n\n\u2618\ufe0f Growth cycle - prioritising liquidity generation to establish a solid baseline for future growth:\n\n\ud83d\udd25 1% burn\n\n\ud83d\udd25 3% yield\n\n\ud83d\udd25 4% liquidity\n\n\u2618\ufe0f Burn cycle - this cycle will accelerate the burn rate of the LEPRACOIN token, increasing rarity and capitalising on the previous growth phase:\n\n\ud83d\udd25 4% burn\n\n\ud83d\udd25 3% yield\n\n\ud83d\udd25 1% liquidity\n\n\u2618\ufe0f Rewards cycle - this cycle will use the growth achieved in the previous phases to reward holders:\n\n\ud83d\udd25 1% burn\n\n\ud83d\udd25 6% yield\n\n\ud83d\udd25 1% liquidity\n\n\u2618\ufe0f Charity cycle - this cycle is where the team gives back and shares its growth with those who need it most. A % of each transaction will be sent to a charity wallet for donations:\n\n\ud83d\udd25 1% burn\n\n\ud83d\udd25 2% yield\n\n\ud83d\udd25 1% liquidity\n\n\ud83d\udd25 4% charity\n\nIt\u2019s the first token I know of to combine yield, burn, charity and liquidity generation in cycles like this, and I\u2019m really interested to see where this will go.\n\nBuilt by an Irish Developer and trusted crypto reviewer, liquidity locked and audit in progress, this is ready to explode. Pot of gold anyone? Lot\u2019s more to come on this one too.\n\nThe Dev has taken Safemoon as a baseline, implemented the Certik audit recommendations (https://www.certik.org/projects/safemoon) and added all the extra features to turn this into something truly unique \u2013 Safemoon on steroids. No other contract is like this.\n\nSupply:\n\nThe initial supply for LEPRACOIN is set to 82,000,000,000 or 82 billion. This will decrease on every transaction due to the burn mechanic built into the contract. The team it the supply at a relatively low number because we are all sick of losing count of the number of zero\u2019s of our holdings. This should simplify things for holders and ensure each LEPRACOIN has real value.\n\nThe supply is distributed as follows:\n\n\ud83d\udd25 5% for private sale - proceeds of which will be used for initial liquidity and locked\n\n\ud83d\udd25 5% to marketing wallet\n\n\ud83d\udd25 40% burned on launch\n\n\ud83d\udd25 50% for liquidity\n\nThere are no team tokens - this is a community coin.\n\nValues & Roadmap:\n\n\u2618\ufe0f The team brings transparency to the core of what they do. They want to spread that Irish cheer to all holders and help everyone achieve their pot of gold without fear of a rug.\n\n\u2618\ufe0f The team has a lot of contacts and are already in talks about marketing partnerships.\n\n\u2618\ufe0f Whitepaper coming soon, along with utility announcement.\n\nSo why not take a punt on it, sit back, and enjoy a Guinness on LEPRACOIN \ud83c\udf7b\n\n\u2618\ufe0f Website: https://www.officiallepracoin. com/\n\n\u2618\ufe0f Telegram: https://t. me/lepracoin\n\n\u2618\ufe0f Twitter: https://twitter. com/LepraCoin\\_BSC\n\n\u2618\ufe0f Buy (9-10% Slippage): https://exchange.pancakeswap. finance/#/swap?inputCurrency=0xcA71DdB30ddC906048bcec5dF305683F289C8C40\n\n\u2618\ufe0f Dextools: https://www.dextools. io/app/pancakeswap/pair-explorer/0xcA71DdB30ddC906048bcec5dF305683F289C8C40\n\nThis is not financial advice, please do your own research.",

Not really.\n\n**They're giving away 10 billion free More tokens ($MORE) to every single person**, and all you've gotta do is spread the word a little.\n\nSounds too simple? It is. It's ridiculously simple, and it takes you 20 seconds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou send them your wallet address, and then you get your 10 BILLION free More tokens.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut what are these More tokens?\n\nJust another memecoin. Like - that's it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me explain real quick --\n\nWhat's the difference between a memecoin that claims to have some revolutionary algorithmic garbage, and a memecoin that does nothing?\n\nI'll give you a few seconds to think...\n\nAnd a few more...\n\n...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, you guessed it - the difference is - nothing. Nothing at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore tokens have the same tokenomics as all the other coins (2% to holders, 2% to liquidity) - they're deflationary cryptocurrency, and they have zero use-case...\n\n**Why no use case? Because use-cases are overrated.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, please good sir, tell me, before people used gold/silver/diamonds/dogecoin, was there a use-case for them?\n\nNo.\n\nBut once people used them, there was the use-case - BECAUSE people had them, people... used them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMoney is an imaginary construct - banks print more all the time.\n\nThe advantage of More Tokens is that they can't print more.\n\nOnce they renounce ownership and burn the liquidity, it'll become decentralized.\n\n**A continually decreasing supply - THIS RIGHT HERE is the key**, and this is what More tokens gives you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo fluff. No BS. You can integrate it into anything you'd like down the line.\n\nThe use-case comes from people USING the tokens in the first place.\n\nSo, instead of trying to create some fancy innovative marketplace blah de blah, More tokens is simply this:\n\n**Having More tokens... gives you more tokens** (since 2% is rewarded to holders).\n\nThe end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd since people need to actually USE the tokens before it becomes mainstream, they're giving everyone 10 BILLION More tokens for completely free.\n\nEveryone. Yes, you, the person reading this, can get 10 billion more tokens for free.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust go to their Telegram group and follow their instructions for your free tokens:\n\n**Telegram:** [t.me/themoretoken](https://t.me/themoretoken)\n\n**Website:** [themoretoken.com](https://themoretoken.com/)\n\n**Twitter:** [twitter.com/themoretoken](https://twitter.com/themoretoken)\n\n**Yes, 10 billion More tokens for completely free.** I can only imagine what they'll be worth once they actually launch - 10x? 100x? 1000x?...

    "text": "\"CUM\" Is the new big deal according to ELON. \nAnd he has tweeted about this twice now.\n\n$CUM INU token is receiving big attention for being the only \"CUM\" Token on the ERC Chain.\n\nWe are littlerally Doge + Cum combined we are the only dog coin with \"CUM\" in our name! Elon will for sure notice us and tweet us next. We are currently the top comment on both of his recent tweets!\n\nAlso other breaking news, one of our stars onboard Yvonne Bar just tweeted, she will be joining our telegram chat in 2hrs for an AMA!!! \n\n\nCuminu Token is planning to make the world first Crypto Pornhub/OnlyFans/Webcams/NFT Platform\n\nEssentially because we are crypto the way models and pornstars will be paid will avoid 20% CGT Costs and CUMINU will take 50% less commission fees then its competitors. Meaning the girls on the platform can earn up to 30% more in revenue. Its a no brainer for them to come onboard, and some big stars are already reaching out.\n\nCheck out the tokenomics further below to understand how the revenue made will be used to burn the Cuminu Tokens and ultimately increase the price of every token circulating making this very attractive for investors.\n\n\n\n- PornHub adverts starting imminently\n\n- CMC: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cuminu/\n- CG: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cum-inu\n\n- $10m Market Cap\n\n- 90% Liquidity locked 2 years (no rug pull capable)\n\n- No 2%+ big wallets\n\n- Team tokens locked (they own 10%, 50% of that is locked for a month)\n\n- First Target Price 100m MC\n\n- Active interest from major influencers in the NSFW space.\n\n- Valid business model which allows us to deliver value to everyone involved\n\n- ETH chain for main coin (stability), BSC for currency (cheap transactions). Fees from tips burned into ETH chain. We charge our stars 50% less than any current platform. (10% versus OnlyFans 20%)\n\n- Some current models on board: Tasha Reign, Lacey London, Blair Williams, Allison Parker, Yvonne Bar, Bonnie Rotten.\n\n- Next model to be announced has 14m+ followers.\n\n- UpNextCrypto dropped a video on us   https://youtu.be/Z71h2DiIZho\n- TheCryptoRoom is also going to drop us on youtube\n\n- TikTik Promos\n\n- In negotiations with a Stripper business in LA that owns 50 clubs and bars in vegas to start advertising. (Strippers are another target for the platform for webcam shows etc)\n\n- Current 10k Giveaway is active, twitter influencors to promote it today. As the MC increases more giveaways will happen with larger Prizes.\n\n- Whitepaper / Audit soon\n\n- CEX Targetting (KuCoin Approached).\n- HotBit has approached us.\n- ProBit has approachsd us.\n\n- Team is always working hard to deliver and everything so far has been self-funded by the Dev.\n\nCons:\nThe only real issue currently is the marketing delays which are out of our control as creators have been late so no more specific time frames will be given now to avoid dissapointment.\n\nNeeds people fluent in other languages to help spread the word to non english speakers (chinese, russian etc.)\n\n\nWhat their platform is going to offer:\n\nCams\nIt\u2019s just as the name suggests. Your favourite amateur stars on webcam hosted by $CUMINU. Models will be booked and tipped in $CUMINU tokens. $CUMINU will charge a 10% transaction fee.\n\nContent\nModels will be able to host a profile on $CUMINU that has a range of unlockable content. These will include photos and videos, private message requests and even NFTs.\n\nAma's\nPlans to host fortnightly AMA (ask me anything) with the biggest names in the industry. The sessions will have tiered membership determined by number of $CUMINU in the holder\u2019s wallet. Viewers will be able to purchase $CUMNIU before the AMA and tip the model throughout the session.\n\nTokenomics / Burn\nThey are going to charge 10% on all transactions through the site. Then use those funds to buy back the $CUMINU and burn them. This makes the token deflationary. OnlyFans isn't for all the degens as you have to give ID and hand over your credit card details. Being able to visit these sites and tip in crypto will be a big win. They\u2019re going to auction NFT's of the models during the AMAs. There are some crazy fans out there.\n\nFor more information:\n\nChart: https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0x7b412f141996411401f57e2ba1bc2235af807d4d\n\nWebsite: http://cuminu.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/CumInuToken\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CumInuToken\n\nUniswap: https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xd6327ce1fb9d6020e8c2c0e124a1ec23dcab7536",

    "text": "Here is my take on why I expect NWC 2.0 to reach the moon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo War Coin 2.0 is a long-term charity coin designed to generate donations which will be given to organizations aimed at helping those in areas troubled by war. You can help people from war torn countries by buying and holding No War Coin. It is a deflationary, anti-whale, anti-bot charity coin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe team is continuously working on improving the anti-bot features to stay ahead of trading bots and has partnered up with a well-known blockchain developer. So far NWC has been able to successfully block over a 1000 transaction attempts from trade bots. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Liquidity is locked and the developer is doxed**. The team consists of dedicated and highly experienced marketeers, developers and community moderators. The community consists of more than 3000 members and is continuing to grow at a rapid pace. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith each transaction a % is added to the charity wallet, which currently stands at around 100 bnb. The community votes on which charity this amount will be spent. After 30 days a new charity is selected and the process starts again. Currently, Red Cross and Doctors without borders have been picked for potential organizations to donate to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ROADMAP :\n\n*Continuous ongoing improvements to block bots from trading NWC* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**June:**\n\nMonth of June 2021: Ongoing big name influencer campaign\n\n2nd of June 2021: Applied for CMC and CG listing\n\n3rd of June 2021: Applied for source code audit with techrate\n\n4th of June 2021: AMA with Aaron Mamuyac\n\n5th of June 2021: AMA with Crypto Eagles\n\n6th of June 2021: AMA on Twitch TV\n\n18-21 June 2021: First donation \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**July:**\n\nImproved website launch\n\nLaunch of NWC clothing brand \n\nCharity NFT launch\n\nPartnerships + marketing\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tokenomics:\n\nMax. supply: 1 quadrillion\n\nInitial burn: 0.4 quadrillion\n\nTx tax:\n\n1.5% Charity\n\n0.5% Redistribution\n\n1% Auto Liquidity\n\n0.5% Burn\n\n1.5% Marketing and Development\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Liquidity locked forever:**\n\n[https://dxsale.app/app/pages/dxlockview?id=0&add=0xDd818fC6A942828b4F8cD7f067c0D8b6e9687B54&type=lplock&chain=BSC](https://dxsale.app/app/pages/dxlockview?id=0&add=0xDd818fC6A942828b4F8cD7f067c0D8b6e9687B54&type=lplock&chain=BSC)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Charity wallet:**\n\nCharity wallet currently at 93 bnb!:\n\n[https://bscscan.com/address/0xe5a5c89cd052c9154f7b69abc28373f79c0340c4](https://bscscan.com/address/0xe5a5c89cd052c9154f7b69abc28373f79c0340c4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Whitepaper:**\n\n[https://www.nowarcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/WhitePaperV2.0-updated.pdf](https://www.nowarcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/WhitePaperV2.0-updated.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Other links:\n\n**\ud83d\udcf1 Telegram:** [**https://t.me/NoWarCoinAntiBot**](https://t.me/NoWarCoinAntiBot)\n\n**\ud83d\udcf1 Website:** [**https://www.nowarcoin.com/**](https://www.nowarcoin.com/)\n\n**\ud83d\udcf1 Twitter:** [**https://twitter.com/NoWarCoin1**](https://twitter.com/NoWarCoin1)\n\n**\ud83d\udcf1 Tiktok:** [**https://www.tiktok.com/@nowarcoinbsc**](https://www.tiktok.com/@nowarcoinbsc)\n\n**\ud83d\udcf1 Twitch:** [**https://www.twitch.tv/nowarcoin**](https://www.twitch.tv/nowarcoin)\n\n**\ud83d\udcf1 PCS:** [**https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xc6274cd1609bc8a29f2718de5c8e8872b98863d5**](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xc6274cd1609bc8a29f2718de5c8e8872b98863d5)",

This is a BSC token, and a token you will grow to love and hold.\n\nThe idea is simple:\n\n1. Buy\n\n2. ???\n\n3. Profit \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\n\nAs you can see, this doesn't have any intricate features, but it has an interesting idea supporting it. There is a pot that will increasingly grow, which will be awarded as pure BNB, to a random holder every 24 hours.\n\nYes, you get BNB gifted, no token airdrops, no dumpy wumpy, no fud in the chat. Just the raw envy of every other holder who now will have to wait until the next day for a chance to be the lucky one.\n\nThe thing is, won't have to rebuy for a chance, nor do anything. Just get a nice bag and hold it. Or you could help the token grow too, but that's up to you. Just keep in mind if you sell, you are out. You have to have had bought more than sold to be elegible.\n\n\n# Now I'm interested, what are the tokenomics?\n\n- \u2705 6% per TX provided to liquidity\u2705\n- \ud83d\udd25 2% per TX is burn, increasing your hold value\n- \ud83d\udce3 2% per TX for marketing purposes, to ensure the token is known by everyone\n\n\n# Okay, but what are the plans for the future\n\nA good start is key to success, so what is known in the present is what it will focus on.\n\n- A good amount of members to support the launch\n- Constant stream of social media posts\n- Coinhunt listing, amongst other advertising sites\n\nDevs are supportive and caring, I can't see any unanswered question or any attempt to withhold information about the project. Zero red flags. Then, everything will be built up progressively to keep the wheel running! I hope the community keeps growing and supporting the token. Spread the word and be rewarded.\n\n# Official links\n\n\ud83d\udce9 Telegram: https://t.me/profitbsc\n\n\ud83c\udf0d Website: Announced!\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 Contract, \u2705 Ownership renounced, and \ud83d\udd12 Liquidity locked will be announced just prior to launch.",

    "text": "I would like to introduce you to a new token called Shenlong. Shenlong is a token, that I have come across per coincidence and after some quick research, I decided to get into it. This Token is one of many with the charity-purpose, but since there are so many charities for dog shelters etc., they decided it's time to help the children (especially the ones living in poverty).\n\nShenlong is barely a week old and managed to do an x20 in its first week. There is currently an x100 potential, since the market cap is still relatively low. And don't worry about whales, we don't have massive whales that are able to crash this token to the ground! (And look at that website design, it's so clean!)\n\nI quote: \"According to UNICEF, there are over 140 million orphans worldwide. In the U.S. alone, over 11 million children live in absolute poverty.\" This is were Shenlong comes in. We as a community want to change this and we believe, that the crypto community is able to do it! Donations towards organizations that take care of children in poverty, ones providing them with presents on holidays, and so on - we want them to witness the good side of the world and humanity!\n\nNow to the part why I believe in Shenlong: I have participated in countless fair launches and have witnessed - as many others - many failures, that died after several hours. But Shenlong is different - it has its ups and downs (the ups were huge lol) and still manages to bring in profits for the ones, that are in for the money. The community loves tackling problems, dips, etc. Kudos to the admins and community!\n\n\u26a1 Renounced ownership! Forever!  \n\ud83d\udd12 LP Locked for 5 years! (see link at the end of the post)\n\u267b\ufe0f 100% Transparency + Fair Launch\n\ud83d\ude80 Shenlong has gone up x20 since launch!

I can't willingly put my money somewhere it could be taken away from me by some ill mannered people.\n\nThis is why NEKODREAMS is such a relief, because it is a decentralized protocol and there is no owner or team.

Ever! This was made possible through a unique launch method where the contract was sent some BNB and then after that a community member launched it. It wasn't launched by the contract creator!\n\nPlease just check it out you don't want to miss this opportunity.

    "text": " A short summary of the last week at Keanu Inu\n\nOn Saturday it was finally time for the long awaited Coingecko listing. Before that the community proved what Twitter raids can do and let the number of holders grow to 13k holders. Since Tuesday we are also listed at Coinmarketcap. Reason for the long wait was a new website, because the first website was rejected. However, the new website was accepted favorably and finally let the coin go further on our roadmap.\n\nOn Tuesday, the devs and admins called everyone together in voice chat where we reached the limits of Telegram. The reason was the announcement of the first collaboration with an influencer. Julius Broadus joined the Keanu Inu community. He is the son of Snoop Dog, the father of all dogs in the memeuniverse. He was so excited about the positive vibe in the community that he invited the team to his birthday party. I hope the team will be able to toast to their successes and make a few contacts in the celebrity world of Los Angeles.\n\nOn Thursday Keanu Inu got a shoutout from an excited Marvin Vettori UFC fighter who will have his championship on June 12th. The Keanu Inu community is behind you brother, you will get the title LFG!\n\nGoal for this weekend.\n\nThe community collects donations to the marketing wallet of Keanu Inu, because the devs have paid everything out of their own pocket so far and want to give something back to the success of Keanu Inu. \n\nThe goal is 50 k dollars for a listing on the CEX MCX which would be a big milestone for Keanu Inu after 26 days. Currently we have raised 45k dollars. Everything is set to Moon. \n\nToday is the perfect opportunity to fill your pockets with Keanu Inu, as the rocket is loading up more and more fuel to soon leave the earth and head for the moon. \n\n**TLDR**: CG and CMC listing, first influencer collaboration as well as promo in the UFC.\n\nWithin 2 days $45k marketing assets accumulated for top tier CEX listing coming in next few days once fundraising goal is reached.\n\nImportant links:\n\n$KEANU is the ONE\n\nHere is the info:\n\n\ud83d\udda5 **Website** \\- https://keanuinu.finance/\n\n**Coingecko**: https://www.coingecko.com/de/munze/keanu-inu\n\n**CoinMarketcap**: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/keanu-inu/\n\n**Twitter**: https://twitter.com/InuKeanu\n\n**Instagram**: https://www.instagram.com/keanuinutoken/?igshid=1rwvzagad1s48\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 **Chart** \\- https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0xfee4800067bfc9dff564d116cba4d4b16ca7b7b3\n\n**Buy**: https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x106552c11272420aad5d7e94f8acab9095a6c952\n\n**Etherscan**: https://etherscan.io/token/0x106552c11272420aad5d7e94f8acab9095a6c952?a=0xb731034550f814a4e995605e0cd093ff5a32b525\n\n\ud83d\udcdd **Keanu** **Contract** \\- 0x106552c11272420aad5d7e94f8acab9095a6c952\n\n**Liq Burned** https://etherscan.io/tx/0x72c7e6011673e989e2686d9e5b20aa0883677b84afbfa973956dd2c38f5ac465\n\n**Ownership Renounced** https://etherscan.io/tx/0x47a47d52070a640d976635d82abb1bf60c730be2fdfd846dc4854d43712c1774\n\n**Bilaxy**: https://bilaxy.com/trade/KEANU\\_ETH\n\n**Subreddit**: r/keanuInu",

    "text": "\"CUM\" Is the new big deal according to ELON. \n$Cum Inu token will give you just that ;)\n\n\n\nCuminu is planning to make the world first Crypto Pornhub.\n\nEssentially because we are crypto the way models and pornstars will be paid will avoid 20% CGT Costs and CUMINU will take 50% less commission fees then its competitors. Meaning the girls on the platform can earn up to 30% more in revenue. Its a no brainer for them to come onboard, and some big stars are already reaching out.\n\nCheck out the tokenomics further below to understand how the revenue made will be used to burn the Cuminu Tokens and ultimately increase the price of every token circulating making this very attractive for investors.\n\n\n\n- PornHub adverts starting imminently\n\n- CMC: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cuminu/\n- CG: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cum-inu\n\n- $10m Market Cap\n\n- 90% Liquidity locked 2 years (no rug pull capable)\n\n- No 2%+ big wallets\n\n- Team tokens locked (they own 10%, 50% of that is locked for a month)\n\n- First Target Price 100m MC\n\n- Active interest from major influencers in the NSFW space.\n\n- Valid business model which allows us to deliver value to everyone involved\n\n- ETH chain for main coin (stability), BSC for currency (cheap transactions). Fees from tips burned into ETH chain. We charge our stars 50% less than any current platform. (10% versus OnlyFans 20%)\n\n- Some current models on board: Tasha Reign, Lacey London, Blair Williams, Allison Parker, Yvonne Bar, Bonnie Rotten.\n\n- Next model to be announced has 14m+ followers.\n\n- UpNextCrypto dropped a video on us   https://youtu.be/Z71h2DiIZho\n- TheCryptoRoom is also going to drop us on youtube\n\n- TikTik Promos\n\n- In negotiations with a Stripper business in LA that owns 50 clubs and bars in vegas to start advertising. (Strippers are another target for the platform for webcam shows etc)\n\n- Current 10k Giveaway is active, twitter influencors to promote it today. As the MC increases more giveaways will happen with larger Prizes.\n\n- Whitepaper / Audit soon\n\n- CEX Targetting (KuCoin Approached).\n- HotBit has approached us.\n- ProBit has approachsd us.\n\n- Team is always working hard to deliver and everything so far has been self-funded by the Dev.\n\nCons:\nThe only real issue currently is the marketing delays which are out of our control as creators have been late so no more specific time frames will be given now to avoid dissapointment.\n\nNeeds people fluent in other languages to help spread the word to non english speakers (chinese, russian etc.)\n\n\nWhat their platform is going to offer:\n\nCams\nIt\u2019s just as the name suggests. Your favourite amateur stars on webcam hosted by $CUMINU. Models will be booked and tipped in $CUMINU tokens. $CUMINU will charge a 10% transaction fee.\n\nContent\nModels will be able to host a profile on $CUMINU that has a range of unlockable content. These will include photos and videos, private message requests and even NFTs.\n\nAma's\nPlans to host fortnightly AMA (ask me anything) with the biggest names in the industry. The sessions will have tiered membership determined by number of $CUMINU in the holder\u2019s wallet. Viewers will be able to purchase $CUMNIU before the AMA and tip the model throughout the session.\n\nTokenomics / Burn\nThey are going to charge 10% on all transactions through the site. Then use those funds to buy back the $CUMINU and burn them. This makes the token deflationary. OnlyFans isn't for all the degens as you have to give ID and hand over your credit card details. Being able to visit these sites and tip in crypto will be a big win. They\u2019re going to auction NFT's of the models during the AMAs. There are some crazy fans out there.\n\nFor more information:\n\nChart: https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0x7b412f141996411401f57e2ba1bc2235af807d4d\n\nWebsite: http://cuminu.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/CumInuToken\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CumInuToken\n\nUniswap: https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xd6327ce1fb9d6020e8c2c0e124a1ec23dcab7536",

He ran off, and it\u2019s of utmost importance that we **#findSHIBBY**. OK wait, let me start from the beginning\u2026\n\nMy name is Nico and I\u2019m co-founding Shibby.finance: an open and transparent, technically-improved SafeMoon fork, addressing all issues from their Certik audit. Shibby will bring the **first DAO to BSC** including [snapshot.org](https://snapshot.org) proposals, after working with Realitio's development team to help bring their oracle to the chain. The power of DAO will guide charitable spending towards services for disabled dogs, rather than using a Multisig account, to keep everything open and FUD-proof.\n\nShibby puts a 7% tax on all transactions; burning 2.5%, locking 2% in liquidity, reflecting 1.5% to holders and collecting 1% to enable the DAO's charitable funding. We'll burn over half of the total supply before launch plus whatever is left unsold from the presale. Our fair launch presale limits 1 BNB per wallet and with a starting market cap of 250-400 BNB ($100k-160k), presale investors have a fair chance to get in on the ground floor of an innovative project.\n\nBut enough with all that technical jargon! Back to why we need to #findSHIBBY.\n\nYesterday evening, I received a threatening message from the future: to be precise, from the year 2042. The young woman looking astonishingly similar to our spokesperson delivered a warning from the future that we cannot afford to ignore.\n\nOn top of everything, now SHIBBY has disappeared, and without him our project is without a mascot\u2026 without love\u2026 without a savior!\n\nShibby has always had a mind of his own, and runs off for weeks. We\u2019ve been through a lot, like the time we were caught in Tijuana with 5 escort dogs and a fresh load of raw meat. He may be a derpy doggo but that boi is a bully.\n\nShibby has a rare condition called Canine Compulsive Disorder with a side of separation anxiety. He spent years chasing his tail until we had finally found a successful therapy using CBD oil. Shibby being SHIBBY, he didn't stop there, and started stealing my weed and next thing you know he had all the neighborhood dogs hooked and loving life. He may not play by the rules, but Shibby has a heart for his doggos and will do anything to improve their lives.\n\nNormally by now, Shibby would be back with some glitter in his fur and lipstick on his nose... but he hasn\u2019t been back. Yesterday his GPS tracker shut off, and not long after we received this alarming news from the future.\n\nSomething is wrong. Shibby has disappeared, and we as the crypto community need to find him and make it right. Otherwise it won\u2019t just be Shibby in trouble... the broadcast from 2042 claims the entire human race will spiral into self-destruction if we don\u2019t act now to #findSHIBBY\n\nWATCH THIS **ACTUAL VIDEO MESSAGE FROM THE FUTURE** TO SEE FOR YOURSELF:\n\n\ud83d\udcfa [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olTevkp69\\_U**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olTevkp69_U) \ud83d\udcfa\n\n\ud83d\udc15\u200d\ud83e\uddba **PRESALE INFO** \ud83d\udc15\u200d\ud83e\uddba\n\n\ud83d\udc3e **DXSale link**: [https://dxsale.app/app/pages/defipresale?saleID=2806&chain=BSC](https://dxsale.app/app/pages/defipresale?saleID=2806&chain=BSC)\n\n\ud83d\udc3e **Presale price**: 700.000.000 per BNB (get 10% more $SHIBBY in presale)\n\n\ud83d\udc3e **Listing price**: 630.000.000 per BNB (10% higher than presale price)\n\n\ud83d\udc3e **70%** presale funds locked to liquidity until 2042 for *Shibby's planetary defense fund*\n\n\ud83d\udc3e **30%** presale funds to cover #findSHIBBY marketing campaign, CG/CMC listings, audit, etc\n\n\ud83d\udc3e Buy on Pancakeswap after presale: [https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?inputCurrency=0xB1035523a844371C2877f8a3b2F2f8d337403b6F](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?inputCurrency=0xB1035523a844371C2877f8a3b2F2f8d337403b6F)\n\nBeyond the 70% we're locking in liquidity, the remaining presale funds have been budgeted towards a brilliant targeted marketing campaign including media around the #findSHIBBY story. We have a plan to get Shibby back along with other disabled dogs who are in need. Together we\u2019ll Make Dog Lives Great Again :D\n\n*So what can you do to help?*\n\nWe\u2019ve put a bounty out for Shibby that we\u2019ll be paying weekly, with clues to help in the search.\n\n*How can you participate while waiting for clues?*\n\nPost a funny picture, meme, song, poem, or anything that will put the community in the spirit to help #findSHIBBY and get the hashtag trending.\n\nOver the coming months, our search for Shibby will bring us to the brink of our existential dread and back again with the greatest puzzle ever faced by our crypto community.\n\nIn the end, SHIBBY isn\u2019t just another MEMECOIN. It\u2019s an attempt to build charitable giving into an investment in a sustainable and representative way. We\u2019ve made sure to design our tokenomics to reward shareholders, locking our liquidity, continuously deflating the total supply and reflecting rewards to $SHIBBY holders with each transaction.  Saving doggos with the power of DAO!\n\nHelp us #findSHIBBY. You\u2019re our only hope.\n\nWith love for all dogs in the universe,\n\nNico\n\nChief Operating Officer",

The beauty of it all it that you do not have to contribute to refer others and receive $SK tokens as compensation.\n\n**Distribution Phase**\n\nWhen the event is over, and after we have double and triple checked everything for accuracy. We will complete the event and in one single transaction launch $SK on PancakeSwap\n\n* We will mint all our tokens\n* Setup the **Lazarus Pit** with an initial 24% burn\n* Initialize Liquidity Pools for PCS trading and PERMANENTLY lock 60% of entire supply\n* \\*\\*Market buy for all contributors.(10% of total token supply will be distributed among contributors).\\*\\*\n\n**Lazarus Pit**\n\n* The Lazarus Pit is just one of our ways of rewarding long term hodlers.\n* 24% of total token supply sent to contract on mint\n* When contract reaches => 51% of the total supply, anything above 50% will be redistributed back to hodlers of $SK.\n\n**Anti Pump Dump Mechanics**\n\nMinimum 10% Transaction Tax on all Buys/Sells and Transfers.\n\nDuring strategic vault buybacks, double digit fees will be initiated up to 20% on sells. We will then strategic use our reusable vault to build price floor constantly.\n\nOur team feels this is a much more improved and refined buyback/burn system than an automatic always on system. A more strategic approach to liquidity, buybacks and token burning will give our network the strength and stability it needs to grow.\n\n**Base Transaction Tax**: 10% split as follows\n\n* 3% Automatic sent to Lazarus Pit\n* 3% Tribute to our network Heroes\n* 2% Sent to $SK Vault for strategic buybacks & mega pumps, adding more locked liquidity and more\n* 2% To our Developer Team to keep the lights on and bringing us cool tech and tools\n\n**DefiWatcher2.0 -- Charts, in-depth blockchain analytics**\n\nWe created DefiWatcher originally as a community tool to help the Bankroll Network be able to have a more clear picture of the daily transactions and on chain data.\n\nWith 2.0 we want to bring this insight to all defi networks and we want to heavily expand on this concept. DefiWatcher is our league's watchtower.\n\nSideKick is the definition of community and driven.

    "text": "Hi Guys,\n\nI have been in this project for some days now and i got to say, that the community is strong! The team has been doing everything they told so far!   \nThis coin is my new GEM. \n\nThey are trending on poocoin at the moment, and they have alot more to come! \n\nHere a summary from their TG: \n\n **Brief Summary \ud83c\udf74**\n\n* \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udc67\u200d\ud83d\udc67 2500+ Holders\n* \ud83c\udf4d   5000+ Transactions\n* \u2604\ufe0f   90% of Liquidity Pools Burnt \n* \ud83c\udfcc\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f    135 BNB in Liquidity Pool (as of 05/06/2021)\n* \ud83c\udf7e   $648k Market Capitalization (as of 05/06/2021)\n* \ud83c\udf96 Table of Contents (for the level 50 Wojaks) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1   Project Information**\n\n1.1    What\u2019s it all about?\n\n1.2    What tools will be provided?\n\n2   Can We Trust SafeWojak?\n\n3  Wojanomics\n\n4   Wojinks (Links, I tried)\n\n \n\n1. Project Information\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.1   What\u2019s it all about?\n\n SafeWojak is a retail friendly due diligence platform, which aims to alleviate traders from falling victim to unaudited and malicious token contracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTheir goal is to equip crypto traders with the necessary tools to perform adequate risk assessment, screening, charting and advanced trading.\n\n \n\n1.2   What tools will be provided?\n\n I really can\u2019t explain this better than they already have on their White Paper. Just read through it, and if that\u2019s not possible (why Wojak, why) then fine; \n\n  i)    Due Diligence Platform \n\n  ii)   WojakSwap\n\n  iii)  SafeWojak App\n\n  iv)  WojakDEX\n\nWhite Paper: Visit their website\n\n \n\n**2. Can We Trust SafeWojak**\n\nWell, here\u2019s my 2 cents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey have burnt almost all of their liquidity pool tokens. This is as safu as it gets in this minefield of a market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDev\u2019s are almost always available to answer my questions, and to a level of competency I can appreciate.\n\nProposed tools are in alpha testing, beyond the typical projects posted on BSC which are merely in the conceptual stages.\n\n \n\n**3. Wojanomics**\n\n* 5% Tax on transactions, where\n* 3% Redistributed, to myself and all fellow Wojaks alike  \n* 2% Development Fund, makes sense - they need some way to sustain the project\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs mentioned earlier, they have burnt the LP, which is incredibly rare. Proof of this is on the BSC network. Just view their LP holders (easy way to find this is on PooCoin on the left).\n\n**4. Wojinks**\n\n**Contract Address:** 0xacce5119881693b1502ecaf732eb1d592adfc54b\n\n**Website:** https://safewojak.com/\n\n**Telegram:** https://t.me/SafeWojak\n\n**Chart (PooCoin):** poocoin.app/tokens/0xacce5119881693b1502ecaf732eb1d592adfc54b\n\n \n\nI like these guys, you probably should too (probably not financial advice).\n\nI could have included details on their roadmap, but this is pretty clear on their site, so have at it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce again, do your own research, and happy investing!",

I held when I 50x'd (day 1 investor) and I even bought more at the top and I still confidently hold. The team is as transparent as it gets, and communicates everything to the community well. I'm so sick of being rugpulled from shit coins being shilled on CMS...I literally sold everything and just hold EVO.

The fee gradually increases as 1.275M tokens are burnt. Cycle comes to an end when we reach total 1.275M tokens burnt, 50% of the burn amount is distributed to holders, and 50% goes  to permanent burn. Each new cycle starts at 5% tax. \n\nExchange: We will be launching on Pancake.Finance 50% of all pre-sale funds will be used to provide liquidity and liquidity will be locked via Unicrypt for 3 months.\n\nSmart Contract: done\nVerified by source \u2705\nAudit under review \u2611\ufe0f\n\nHow it works: By holding Pluton X  \"$PLX\" token through deflationary cycles, there will be a dramatic increment in holdings and value, rewarding early adopters the most value.The cycle life depends on volume of buy/sell and send transactions. In the early stages, we will go through cycles rapidly. The more cycles Pluton X finishes, the more volume it will take to finish new cycles. For Pluton X holders this implies that early reception and holding gets compensated exceptionally, as Pluton X Rebases continue compounding and Total Supply continues to get diminished. The entirety of this is done to guarantee a drawn out store of significant worth which will be coordinated into the DeFi system. There will be a dashboard with detailed statistics available to view live cycle stats, we will also have a bot on telegram broadcasting live stats..\n\nWebsite: https://plutonx.finance\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CoinPlu\nWhite Paper: Done\nTg: https://t.me/plutonxofficialchatgroup\nRoadmap:\n\nSmart contract \u2705\nWebsite: \u2705\nPre-sale \u2611\ufe0f\nPancakeswap launch: \u2611\ufe0f\nMarketing campaign \u2611\ufe0f\nSmart Contract (Usecase) \u2611\ufe0f\nCMC/CG/Bitmart Listing \u2611\ufe0f\nFuture roadmap \u2611\ufe0f\n\nPre-sale time will be announced  soon, we will launch on pancake immediately after pre-sale ends.\n\n\nTokenonmics: \n69M Pre-sale\n34.5M Pancakeswap Liquidity\n21M Airdrop, marketing, development",

    "title": "\ud83c\udf40$LEPRACOIN | Unique Tokenomics Cycles | Irish Dev | Very transparent | Audit completed \u2705 | LP Locked | LOW MCAP",
    "text": "\ud83c\udf40$LEPRACOIN just launched on BSC folks, absolutely the newest real hidden gem and has a potential to explode anytime soon! \n\nHere's WHY:\n\nAmazing dedicated dev and team, not just another pump and dump. The dev and team actually has big plans with this and they are very transparent, so I keep an eye on this one. I already aped in here! \n\nThe project is introducing something completely unique \u2013 the concept of cycles \u267b\ufe0f\n\n\ud83d\udd39TOKENOMICS\ud83d\udd38\n\nAs the LEPRACOIN token and project progresses, the needs of holders, and the movement of the coin demands something more fluid in terms of tokenomics. The transaction fee is 8%, but each cycle will have different tokenomics in how that fee is distributed, designed for maximum growth potential. Each cycle last for 1 week initially, increasing to monthly cycles after that. \n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown of each cycle:\n\n\n\u267b\ufe0f Growth cycle - prioritising liquidity generation to establish a solid baseline for future growth:\n\n- 1% burn\n\n-  3% yield\n\n-  4% liquidity\n\n\u267b\ufe0f Rewards cycle - this cycle will use the growth achieved in the previous phases to reward holders:\n\n- 1% burn\n\n- 6% yield\n\n- 1% liquidity\n\n\n\u267b\ufe0f Charity cycle - this cycle is where the team gives back and shares its growth with those who need it most. A % of each transaction will be sent to a charity wallet for donations:\n\n- 1% burn\n\n- 2% yield\n\n- 1% liquidity\n\n- 4% charity\n\n\nIt\u2019s the first token I know of to combine yield, burn, charity and liquidity generation in cycles like this, and I\u2019m really interested to see where this will go. \n\n\nBuilt by an Irish Developer and trusted crypto reviewer, liquidity locked and audit in progress, this is ready to explode. Pot of gold anyone? Lot\u2019s more to come on this one too.\n\n\nThe Dev has taken Safemoon as a baseline, implemented the Certik audit recommendations (https://www.certik. org/projects/safemoon) and added all the extra features to turn this into something truly unique \u2013 Safemoon on steroids. No other contract is like this.\n\n\nSupply:\n\nThe initial supply for LEPRACOIN is set to 82,000,000,000 or 82 billion. This will decrease on every transaction due to the burn mechanic built into the contract. The team it the supply at a relatively low number because we are all sick of losing count of the number of zero\u2019s of our holdings. This should simplify things for holders and ensure each LEPRACOIN has real value.\n\n\nThe supply is distributed as follows:\n\n\u2705 5% for private sale - proceeds of which will be used for initial liquidity and locked\n\n\u2705 5% to marketing wallet\n\n\u2705 40% burned on launch\n\n\u2705 50% for liquidity\n\nThere are no team tokens - this is a community coin.\n\n\ud83d\udd25LOW MCAP 1M, STILL EARLY TO HOPE IN \u203c\ufe0f\n\nValues & Roadmap:\n\nThe team brings transparency to the core of what they do. They want to spread that Irish cheer to all holders and help everyone achieve their pot of gold without fear of a rug.\n\nThe team has a lot of contacts and are already in talks about marketing partnerships. \n\n2 Big AMA's lined up for next week. To be announced this weekend! \n\n(Whitepaper coming soon, along with utility announcement) \n\nAlready listed on livecoinwatch & coin sniper, CG & CMC applications have been submitted!\n\nSo why not take a punt on it, sit back, and enjoy a Guinness on LEPRACOIN \ud83c\udf7b\n\nBuy (9-10% slippage):\nhttps:// exchange.pancakeswap. finance/#/swap?inputCurrency=0xcA71DdB30ddC906048bcec5dF305683F289C8C40\n\nContract:\n0xcA71DdB30ddC906048bcec5dF305683F289C8C40\n\n\ud83c\udf10Website: https://www.officiallepracoin. com/\n\n\ud83d\udcf2 Telegram: https://t. me/lepracoin\n\n\ud83d\udc26 Twitter: https://twitter. com/LepraCoin_BSC\n\n\ud83d\udcca Dextools: https://www.dextools. io/app/pancakeswap/pair-explorer/0xcA71DdB30ddC906048bcec5dF305683F289C8C40",

    "text": "$StopElon started off like most potential moonshots, with a vision and a out of reach plan. We are becoming so much more however. People from all around the globe are sticking up against the effects of manipulation from Elon Musk and his lies and deceit he used to post a $100m profit on Q1 for Tesla. Billions and billions of USD was lost from investors around the world just so he can barely scrape by with his nonprofitable company.\n\nTesla workers deserve a union and fair wages. Elon doesn\u2019t care however, and profits millions off their lack of rights while he also profits off of average investors by manipulating crypto. No one person should have this much power, money, and benefit off of the financial losses and sufferings of the common man, in the way Elon Musk does.\n\nWhat no one envisioned however, was how there would be many converging factors that could allow this community to grow & become a rallying point for everyone that is fed up with the rich and powerful not only profiting off of market manipulation, but also; Lack of workers rights, Anti-Union policies, and especially the non stop taking advantage of poorer counties. These people have left the everyday person in their rear view mirror, while they get richer and richer.\n\n$StopElon is available on Telegram in (18) different languages as the community has pitched in to design our ecosystem in a way that encourages coin holder engagement. Our community is very active and we have daily voice AMAs with the chat. \n\nUpdates:\n\nThe team did it. We are officially signed on a contract to be listed on a significant exchange. The devs said we skipped over minor exchanges, our tokenomics will be supported in the form of airdrops, and we with trade under STEL/USDT and STEL/ETH. This is big. \n\n\nIf you live in the Bay Area, do not miss out! StopElon team has acquired a Tesla and wrapped it in our new branding. It looks incredible. They will be driving it around Saturday, and the community is hosting a event on Sunday, June 6th 12pm at Tesla factories in Fremont, California. Our new merch will be revealed, as people that attend get free shirts, masks, water and more!\n\nDaily social media giveaways have started. So do not miss out. Something as simple as just a retweet and a follow can give you many chances to win over the next week! \n\nStopElon has been completely rebranded with new a logo, telegram stickers, and an whole new website. \n\nNews is completely going crazy again. Elon is in heat with SEC. As shown on CNBC, WSJ, CNN, and more. Also, we are back in the headlines! Firstly, Forbes Mexico/Columbia/Central America. Then News Au, Hlb be, Laptopmag, and Nzherald. As always, fascinating how word wide this movement is.\n\nWhen it comes to progress on the actual goal, a core team member, Devacor, has made great progress. After talking to a lot of people regarding legal advise, we are looking to create a voting trust. This voting trust can have shares added to it, and many members have already pledged to add the first shares. Meaning, that we are making our first steps towards Tesla\u2019s HQ.\n\nWe have continued to gain holders, now at 21,884+ and total transactions have now surpassed 62,000\n\nCheck our TG for daily updates\n\nTokenomics: 0.1% max buy/sell 10% tax total (to holders and LP) 40% initial burn (almost 50% burn as of now!) 5% dev marketing wallet 5% community wallet $21M+ Marketcap 21,884+ Holders\n\n\u2705 Verified contract 0xd83cec69ed9d8044597a793445c86a5e763b0e3d\n\nTwitter: STOPELON (@STOPELON_BSC) / Twitter\n\n\ud83d\udcf1English Telegram (@StopElon_BSC)\n\n\ud83c\udf10 Website: www.StopElon.space\n\n\ud83d\udcc8Chart: https://charts.bogged.finance/?token=0xD83cec69ED9d8044597A793445C86a5e763b0E3D\n\n\ud83e\udd5e Buy (v2, slippage 12%, 0,1% max) : https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xd83cec69ed9d8044597a793445c86a5e763b0e3d",

Elon has manipulated the market many times before and has made billions. We as traders should seek the same mentality.\n\nThe world of investing & trading is certainly an action-packed exciting world, but this all comes with dark and nasty reciprocal effects\u2014market manipulation. Young people look at trading as a way to get out of the 9am-5pm corporate race but little do they know that their investments can be so negatively affected by famous personalities, that\u2019s right folks we are talking about the notorious Elon Musk.\n\nElon Musk has been using his public social media accounts to constantly manipulate and change the effortless flow & dynamics of the markets. Hard working traders like you & us have been putting so much time & effort into our strategy as well as personal financial risk and just when our trades are going in our favour, BAMN Elon makes one tweet and we are in the hole.\n\nNow don\u2019t get us wrong, we have capitalized on Elon\u2019s open market manipulation, but it is time that all of us retail traders get together and fight this institutionalized market manipulation. WE MUST LOOK AFTER ONE ANOTHER! All these rich personalities need to understand the power of the common retail trader, alone we are nothing but together we can take down any force that comes into our way whether that\u2019s Elon or corrupt hedge funds. Friends & future entrepreneurs, let\u2019s all join hands together and shout ELON be gone! Our community power will enable us to withstand any Elon tweet.\n\nCrypto is the next asset class that will make millionaires from younger age groups. Warren buffet & committee were lucky that they had the opportunity to buy AAPL, COCA COLA shares etc for so cheap. We as young people need to capitalize on the present opportunities.\n\nWhile making money we cannot forget to give back. That\u2019s why ElonBeGone will be donating $5000 to a charity of the communities choice at $1 million MC. We will bring with donating to covid relief in India just as Vitalik did to show that crypto can be used as a form of good to the world we line in today. As we grow and reach milestones we\u2019d like to keep donating to charities with the help of our community.\n\nEBG automatic deflationary liquidity acquisition yield farm contract.\n\n\u2705 Contract is verified\n\n\u2705 Liquidity Locked 1 year\n\n\u2705 Contract ownership will be renounced at launch\n\nTokenomics\n\nWe have a limited supply unlike other coins that have an unlimited amount of tokens so the price of $1 can be achieved faster!\n\nTotal Supply : 10,000,000,000 EBG\n\n\ud83d\udd25Burn : 5,000,000,000 EBG\n\n\ud83e\udd8dPresale price : 25% less than listing price TBD\n\n\ud83e\udd8dListing Price : TBD\n\n\ud83e\udd8dSoft cap: TBD - Hard cap: TBD\n\nEach transaction\n\n\ud83d\udd25burn(3%)\n\n\ud83d\udcb0added to the liquidity pool (3% fee)\n\n\ud83d\ude4c redistribution to holders(5% fee)\n\nThe longer you hold the more you earn it\u2019s as simple as that.

    "text": "So I just wanted to take a moment to give my own input.  I've personally spoke with the Dev on this project a few times and he has been a pretty solid guy.  He came into a bigger project guns blazing after it was abandoned by another dev.  He was able to recover that project and get it into a full rebrand and relaunch.    \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo he took his experience he learned from that project and quite a few others along the way that he helped on, as the Front End Developer and Admin, and started The Space Cowboys.  A place where people can come and be safe from all of the drama, the toxicity, the crypto world.  A place where we can all unite together and bring a concept to reality.  The Space Cowboys are going to hands down be one of the largest, if not the largest, E-Sports related tokens in the crypto space.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI put my trust in the dev.  Hes been honest, straight forward, and honestly.... nice...   Keep an eye on this gem because it won't be the last time you see the name \"The Space Cowboys\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd now the general info.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n The Space Cowboys are bringing crypto to E-Sports. They will start hosting major events and prize pools. Looking to expand further reach into official partnerships with outside brands. They also host giveaways, just finished a meme contest and gave out 15tril SpaceCows. Dev team is solid, doxx'd, has worked on several successful projects.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Space Cowboys will also be hosting weekly Rodeos. All cowboys will come together and submit a form nominating someone in the Twitch community(Can be anyone, doesn't matter if its a gamer, musician, vlogger, irl, etc.) They will then initiate what they like to call \"The Getdown.\" (This will be when we all join the streamers channel \"raiding\" them) and \"The Sheriff\" will make a donation on behalf of \"The Space Cowboys\" (Multiple people will be raided that night)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Rodeo is OUR charity. The Space Cowboys are the charity. As always, do your own research and you will find this is a real gem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo Be Ready. We are the First and Only Crypto Rodeo. Starts 6-5-2021\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh yeah, did I mention that the Dev hasn't done a burn yet?  He wants everyone to benefit from it so he delayed burning any token on launch.  He said burn is coming soon which means everyone that is holding will get token from the burn distribution, pretty awesome huh?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5% Back to Holder from Every Transaction\n\n5% To Liquidity and Marketing  \n(Liquidity is 2% and Marketing is 3%) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\ude80\\*Big marketing planned!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 \\*Audit and white paper coming soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 \\*Charity directly back to the community.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*DOXX Dev\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheck them out below for more information\n\n\ud83d\udcbb The Space Cowboys website: [https://spacecowboys.cc](https://spacecowboys.cc)\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Telegram: [https://t.me/TheSpaceCowboys](https://t.me/TheSpaceCowboys)  \n\n\ud83d\udcbb Twitter: [https://twitter.com/SpaceCowboyOrig](https://twitter.com/SpaceCowboyOrig)  \n\n\ud83d\udcbb Pancakeswap link: [https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?inputCurrency=0xe13adcc13a61f134017530f2eb345c417438d5ca](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?inputCurrency=0xe13adcc13a61f134017530f2eb345c417438d5ca)",

Hyper Deflate is here to fix those 2 stories. Wouldn't it be nice to have a way to make sure coins are safe, whilst holding a token with a moonshot potential?\nHere is the rundown:\nWhen you hold, your token balance remains constant. Whilst holding, other transactions will occur and the 10% burn will decrease the total supply of HDFL. E.g - At $1m market cap, with $1m daily volume, 10% of the remaining supply is burned leaving the same liquidity, but attributable to less tokens (at a constant price)\nYou may have noticed posts from Hyper Deflate over the last few days and there will likely be many more.

    "text": "Everyone in the crypto world has experienced a scam at one point or another..\n\nOne minute you're making a sick 10x, the next you're **getting rugged**.\n\nPogged Finance says **NO more rugs**.\n\nThey're bringing the education and tools to DEFI (Crypto) to give users a solid base to judge the safety of their next investment.\n\nThe developers of Pogged.Finance have done multiple live AMA's, allowing everyone to get educated and see their tools in action. You can view the vods and upcoming AMA's on their twitch account: [https://twitch.tv/PoggedFinance](https://twitch.tv/PoggedFinance).\n\n**The tokenomics for Pogged are as follows:**\n\n\\- 8% Tax: While they work to develop the Pogged suite of rug detection tools, they decided to give back to their holders in another way. They tax each sale at 8%, giving 4% back to the holders and putting 4% into the liquidity pool. This gives all of holders incentive, whether they're big or small.\n\n\\- 2% Max wallet: They understand that the lifespan of a coin depends on its wallet distribution. That's why they implemented a 2% maximum wallet (before reflection). By limiting the amount that potential whales are able to hold, it's easier for you to get a bigger slice of the pie while you're still early.\n\n\\- 1% Max transaction: In the same vein as the maximum wallet, they understand that large transactions can have a huge impact on the price of a coin. They decided to mitigate this by capping the maximum buy/sell to half of the maximum wallet amount.\n\n**The current roadmap for Pogged is as follows (subject to change):**\n\n## Q2 2021\n\n* Build alpha version of DApp, grant access to 1% holders\n* Obtain support from influencers and increase marketing efforts\n* Continue to grow as a community\n\n## Q3 2021\n\n* Deploy beta version of DApp, grant access to 0.5% holders\n* Explore new avenues including a launchpad and audits\n\n## Q4 2021\n\n* Deploy stable version of DApp, grant access to 0.02% holders\n* Continue to update the tools and keep them current against new threats\n\nThe community is growing larger every day: [https://t.me/PoggedFinance](https://t.me/PoggedFinance)\n\nAnd here's their shiny new website - [https://pogged.finance](https://pogged.finance/)\n\nThey are currently offering a demo version of their rug screening tool for POG holders in a private Discord server. Get in the Telegram and ask for access, and they'll be happy to let you on board as long as you're holding some POG. The community is more than happy to help answer any questions as well. If all you want to do is have a contract checked, feel free to jump in ask in the public channel and one of their holders will definitely help you out.",

ChubbyShiba also has above average token disbursement. \n\nThere is a 10% tax on each transaction. 8% of the tax is distributed amongst all token holders. The more $CHSHIBA you hold, the larger your distribution. The remaining 2% goes into liquidity.\n\n*The burn wallet, which is the largest wallet, also receives a portion of the disbursement.

They believed that they could make a positive impact on the world, without making it about themselves. So from the beginning, members of the growing community we\u2019re recruited.

    "text": "CMS members have at least 2 stories in common:\n\n\\- They've lost out from holding bad projects.\n\n\\- They've missed the magical 10000x after selling too early.\n\nSpoiler Alert. Hyper Deflate is here to fix those 2 stories. Wouldn't it be nice to have a way to make sure coins are safe, whilst holding a token with a moonshot potential?\n\nHere is the rundown:\n\nWhen you hold, your token balance remains constant. Whilst holding, other transactions will occur and the 10% burn will decrease the total supply of HDFL. E.g - At $1m market cap, with $1m daily volume, 10% of the remaining supply is burned leaving the same liquidity, but attributable to less tokens (at a constant price)\n\nYou may have noticed posts from Hyper Deflate over the last few days and there will likely be many more. This is the first in a series of daily progress updates to keep the CMS community informed on how HDFL is growing the project each day.\n\n24h Progress Update:\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Tokens Burned Since Launch - 21.1%\n\n\u2705 White paper complete and ready for release (June 4th 9pm EST)\n\n\u2705 3 Free-to-enter giveaways launched worth over $1,000\n\n\u2705 Discord server almost complete\n\n\u2705 Major collaboration agreed upon - Details coming June 5th\n\n\u2705 Plenty more in the works however HDFL will only ever underpromise, and over deliver\n\nPhase 2 of the marketing plan has been initiated by the devs to take Hyper Deflate to all time highs, whilst establishing and nurturing the market\u2019s perception of the project's long term future.\n\nIf there is one coin with the potential to achieve that magical 10000x, would it be crazy to suggest it is this one?\n\nAMA live in the telegram group at 10pm EST.

I know the dev from before the project was launched and he is a genuine and honest soul who cares for the community especially for those who are traumatized through the vast ocean of sketchy shit going on in the bsc world.\n\nWhitepaper just dropped, check it out. Unique usecase and a very good vision behind this project to provide people a safe space for their investments.\n\nI'm very bullish on this one and in for the long-hold. All of you who are reading this: you are super early (yeah you heard that one before), but this is truly (and I kid you not because I hate scammers) one of those rare gems whose potential is very high and you are actually safe.\nThere were absolutely no dev wallets, he missed out on the presale and bought in just like any other guy once launched.\n\ndyor and convince yourself.",

Please do your own DD before investing!\\*\\*)\n\nThis is the first time that I've gotten in on a project like this at launch and it's such a cool concept. I'm not the biggest NFT person, but I think that this platform has a ton of promise. And, since Ethereum 2.0 is supposed to reduce the environmental impact of Ethereum to basically nothing, I think that it's the perfect time to get in early on a whole new NFT platform.\n\nMasterBrews has a gigantic [lineup of artists](https://masterbrews.cards/artists) producing NFTs for the platform, from relatively unknown artists all the way to Mark McKenna!\n\nMasterBrews is building a unique NFT platform that allows you buy/sell/trade with existing \"ingredients\" that you can then combine into your own unique NFT. You can even come up with, mint, and sell your own \"recipes\" for others to purchase for their NFTs, all with no transaction or royalty fees.\n\nAnd, best of all (in my opinion), the MasterBrews platform even offers the chance for **passive income** at certain tiers that you can buy into right now on their [main page](https://masterbrews.cards/)!\n\nInfo on their ecosystem is [HERE](https://masterbrews.cards/ecoSystem).\n\nInfo on their team members is [HERE](https://masterbrews.cards/team).\n\nSpecific info on $MBREW tokenomics is [HERE](https://masterbrews.cards/tokenomics).\n\nQuick rundown on $MBREW tokenomics: Utility coin for the platform, pre-minted fixed supply of 1 billion, liquidity locked for 12 months, 50% of total supply available to the public (20% to marketing and strategic partners, 10% to external investors, 20% to founders). The value of the coin depends heavily on the usage of the platform, so it should be rug-proof (as far as I can see).\n\nDev team is super active and easy to reach on Discord! They've been super quick to answer people's questions so far.\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.gg/G3RxS5Cx](https://discord.gg/G3RxS5Cx)\n\nSite for Launch Sale: [https://masterbrews.cards/](https://masterbrews.cards/)\n\nRoadmap: [https://masterbrews.cards/roadmap](https://masterbrews.cards/roadmap)\n\nAll Current Promos: [https://masterbrews.cards/promo](https://masterbrews.cards/promo)",

    "text": "Well ladies and gentlemen, it has undeniably been a crazy few weeks of snakes and ladders in the crypto universe. We have seen some ups, we have seen some downs. we have seen some dips and some ups, some dip dips and some slight up ups again. Currently who knows what\u2019s going on, right?! \n\n\nIf it isn\u2019t ELON, it\u2019s CHINA, if it isn\u2019t CHINA it\u2019s ELON. BTC has been trading like a certified yo-yo from $40k - $30k and back again. \n\n\nHowever, during all of this market madness there has been one behemoth slowly gathering steam... one community of diamond handed hodlers to rule them all... one crack team of dedicated devs, achieving milestone after milestone and delivering undeniable value to their holderbase. At a pace NEVER seen before in the BSC universe... I present to you... AERDROP\n\n\n\u2708\ufe0f Fly comfortably with Aerdrop \u2708\ufe0f\n\n\n**Aerdrop - The past**\n\n\nIn the last 31 days since the projects inception, the following are a selection of milestones achieved by the dev team:\n\n\n\u2705- CG listing achieved on day 14\n\n\n\u2705 - CMC listing achieved on day 28 \n\n\n\ud83d\ude80 - Bespoke creation of an aerdrop technology that allows AER to partner with BSC projects of their choosing and instantly provide their holders with FREE tokens, delivered right to their BSC wallets instantly.\n\n\nThis was a huge build project and was achieved by the dev team in less than 1 month. YES, you heard it right. The dev team delivered on the initial key milestone of their road map in less than 1 month, and it is FULLY operational. \n\n\n6\ufe0f\u20e3 - SIX partner drops already delivered to hodlers, with a total value of over $20k based on the ATHs achieved post partnership.\n\n\nI\u2019m talking: Chuck Norris token \u2708\ufe0f, WeedShare\u2708\ufe0f, Skynet\u2708\ufe0f, Clearm\u00f8on\u2708\ufe0f, WAIV\u2708\ufe0f, IronyMan\u2708\ufe0f. \n\n\n6\ufe0f\u20e3 - SIX early stage BSC projects that AER holders were given exclusive early access to, with many having unbelievable use cases of their own. Check them out for yourself, some hugely promising projects right here in the list above what you\u2019re reading right now, and you have access to each of them for FREE. Imagine a world where you didn\u2019t have to trawl CMS for hours on end, looking for potential gems amongst all of the rubbish?! Imagine if you had a trusted community to vet the projects, bring them to you, discuss ideas AND invest alongside you as well?! \ud83e\udd2f\ud83c\udf1d\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80 - Marketing value and benefits which are demonstrated and measurable. Partner tokens which were able to instantly meet CG, CMC and TW logo / price requirements due to their AER partnership and immediate 3k+ increase in project holders. Providing instant and undeniable value to partner tokens (not including the chart pumps), which has received unanimous positive feedback from partner dev teams. \n\n\n**Aerdrop - The present**\n\n\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t stop there for this amazing token, not even close.\n\n\nRight now, as we speak, members of the team are in BTC Miami speaking with potential investors and being represented at many events, including the shitcoin conference.\n\n\nMembers of the community are hugely connected with the key speakers, and will also be hosting many parties at the event.\n\n\nThe devs have gone with one goal in mind, and that is to promote this amazing project, to get the word out to as many whales as possible and to close some additional investment into the liquidity pool. \n\n\nThe early news from the conference is very bullish ladies and gentlemen, so strap in for the ride!! This may genuinely be the last time we see this price again. \n\n\nOh, did I also mention that TWO further airdrops are planned for later this very weekend and there are SEVERAL more in the pipeline ready to be closed in the coming days.\n\n\nOnce this plane takes off for good, it just ain\u2019t stopping and every day we get further down the runway and closer to take off!!\n\n\n**Aerdrop - The future**\n\n\nOk, I get it. It all sounds good but you\u2019re still skeptical right?! You would like some free tokens, sure. You would like to know about new partner projects at an early stage of their development, great.\n\n\nYou think this community sounds like it is something truly special, and you know what?! You\u2019re damn right.\n\n\nBut you want to know the end goal. The vision. You want the juicy details on exactly what it is that is gonna take this token out of the stratosphere and into another dimension.\n\n\nWell guys, I bring good news. The devs are cooking up some amazing stuff on that front too. I\u2019ll leave you with this...\n\n\nAerstation is now up and running. Aerdrops will be coming WEEKLY (if not daily!) Aerstation will eventually become hands off, an API where projects simply fill out a form, pay the bnb fee + send tokens, and off they go.\n\n\nCross chain and beyond: Aerdrop want's to be functioning on more than just the BSC and is actively working on solutions for this right now. \n\n\nImagine going to a football game, concert or fucking chess world championship, and everyone in the stadium get's an NFT from that particular event, regardless of chain/ wallet. \n\n\nAerdrop believes they can be the project that makes that happen, and you know what?! With the contacts this team has within the NFT space it just might become a reality. Imagine seeing the AER logo partnering with some of the largest artists in the world, music or otherwise.\n\n\nWe are thinking HUGE picture here and really the SKY is the limit with Aerdrop.\n\n\n\u2708\ufe0f\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1d\n\n\n\ud83d\udcc4 Website including white paper: https://aerdrop.finance\n\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Telegram: https://www.t.me/aerdropofficial\n\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Chart: https://charts.bogged.finance/?token=0x1a6C2c3c52cd3CC21DB2b8f2B331ca9c4780F1Ee",

The main idea behind COCO is to provide a decentralized transaction network that operates on the Binance smart chain (BSC).\n\nAutonomous yield and liquidity generation protocol. Simply hold COCO Swap in your wallet and you will get more.On each transaction the protocol automatically distributes rewards to holders as well as auto-locks liquidity forever. That is fully open-source.\n\n   \n\nCoco Swap liquidity is not locked, meaning that shareholders can withdraw at any given time, which gives more security towards the project.

Right now we are looking for more blockchain coders, if you are interested you can reach us on Telegram!\n\n\ud83c\udf16 **Moonlaunch** \ud83d\ude80  is a project aiming for NFTs, charities and a place to support smaller creators (And the moon, ofcourse)\n\n**Moonlaunch** is a hardfork from safemoon giving it the same features such as:\n\nAutomatic liquidity and passive income rewards for holding.\n\nWe believe in a deflationary coin therefor we went with the safemoon protocol\n\n\ud83c\udf10**Website:** https://www.moonlaunch.eu/   \n\ud83e\udd5e**Buy now on** **Pancakeswap**: https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x601e4cf12608af7a3a2cb3d585c6c5ddb3ecf2e4\n\n \ud83e\uddfe**Token ID**: 0x601e4cf12608af7a3a2cb3d585c6c5ddb3ecf2e4\n\n\u2705**Airdrops!**\n\nThere will be airdrops at 500 - 1 000 - 2 500 - 5 000 - 10 000 holders  \n\n\n\u2705**Automatic Liquidity**\n\n5% of every transaction is automatically put back into liquidity.\n\nDuring a trade, sale or buy 5 is automatically taxed. 50% of the taxed amount (2.5% of transaction) is then converted into BNB and both currencies are automatically converted into liquidity tokens and put in the pancakeswap liquidity pool.\n\nIn short this means that:\n\nYou will always be able to sell and buy, during both highs and lows. The market will stay liquid at all times.\n\n\u2705**Passive income**\n\nAll MoonLaunch holders are passively rewarded by holding their coins in their wallets.\n\n5% of every transaction is split between all holders. The split is calculated based on the percentage of the total market you are holding. If you hold 0.1% of the market you receive 0.1% of the 5%.\n\nAn awesome feature of this tokenomic is that it automatically fights against the effect of big selloffs(whales).\n\nIf someone sells a large amount of MoonLaunch you will receive a large amount.\n\n*Holding Pays off!*\n\n\u2705**Initial 20% Burn**\n\nAt launch we burned 20% of the tokens, so that 1% of each transaction gets sent to the black hole, increasing the value of each coin.\n\n\u2705**Manual burns**  \nThere will be manual burns at 10000, 50000 and 100000 holders.\n\nLike we've stated, we offer a different theme and goal compared to other projects, we strive for real difference in the real world.\n\n\ud83c\udf10**Website**: https://www.moonlaunch.eu/\n\n\ud83d\udcf2**Twitter**: https://twitter.com/MoonLaunchtoken\n\n\ud83d\udcf2**Telegram**: https://t.me/joinchat/NCNx5OiwYWJiNDFk\n\n\ud83d\udcf2**Reddit**: https://www.reddit.com/r/MoonLaunch/\n\n\ud83e\udd5e **Pancakeswap**: https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x601e4cf12608af7a3a2cb3d585c6c5ddb3ecf2e4\n\n\ud83e\uddfe **Chart**: https://charts.bogged.finance/?token=0x601e4Cf12608af7a3a2cB3d585c6c5DDb3ecF2e4",

    "text": "A reflection token with a twist\n\nMoonshield delivers, what many have promised ! Our rewards pool is bursting with BNB, compared to other projects where daily rewards seem tempting, while average investors end up with much less than expected. We refined the famous reflection DEFI mechanism. Learn how!\n\nThe ownership of the contract is renounced and we got audited twice. We love our ever growing community of moonshielders and this is just the beginning.\n\nHere at moonshield, a hard working and responsive team of eager profit-visionaries is in it for the long haul and you won\u2019t miss the memes for the journey to where we all want to hang out during these trying times on this planet : the moon! And this is how this will work out for us :\n\n4% of every buy and sell fill a BNB rewards pool, that is growing with ever increasing trading volume and marketing of the coin. Your share of the total coins is how much you can claim of it every week. At current levels, a 50k dollar investment can yield you about 4 BNB every week - and we are only at a 3.5 million marketcap.\n\nThis weekly claiming leads to much more long term orientation of investors and prevents cheating through whales, who tend to jump in and drain pools of similar projects before the average investor can even claim their fair share. Here at moonshield we prevent such nastiness.\n\nBesides the 4% - 2% of every buy and sell goes directly towards your balance and accumulates there to an ever growing amount of shiny Moonshield tokens.\n\nThe liquidity is locked and 2% of every transaction goes towards the LP on pancake swap.\n\nOur marketing team is goal oriented and eager to push this fresh project to the next level and compete with the big boys. Moonshield is becoming a haven in the floods of new coins, a place where everyone in the community can join with combined effort, to realize a rug free passive income experience for all of us.\n\nThere is an even distribution of wallets as you can see on BSC scan: [https://bscscan.com/token/0xf565aaf0b8eb813a1c8c956d2c59f1ce27fd2366#balances](https://bscscan.com/token/0xf565aaf0b8eb813a1c8c956d2c59f1ce27fd2366#balances)\n\nJoin us on our Telegram: \\[[https://t.me/MoonShieldFinance\\]](https://t.me/MoonShieldFinance])\n\nCoinmarketcap (Just listed!): \\[[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/moonshield/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/moonshield/)\\]\n\n\ud83e\udd8eCoinGecko: \\[[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/moonshield-finance\\]](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/moonshield-finance])\n\nYouTube vid: \\[[https://youtu.be/1Pohw5vWcgk\\]](https://youtu.be/1Pohw5vWcgk])\n\n\ud83c\udf10Website: \\[https://moonshield.finance\\]\n\n\ud83e\udd16Reddit: \\[[https://www.reddit.com/r/MoonShieldFinance\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoonShieldFinance])\n\n\ud83d\udcd4Contract: 0xF565aaf0b8EB813a1c8C956D2C59F1ce27FD2366\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbbDAPP: \\[https://dapp.moonshield.finance\\]\n\n\ud83d\udcddMedium: \\[moonshieldfinance.medium.com\\]\n\nFor further info, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out - come join the community and become a Moonshielder!",

We don\u2019t perceive ticket forging or resale to an unintended recipient as an issue. The threats associated with the wrong people accessing your event are, unfortunately, known. From sexual harassment to active shooter occurrences, tracing tickets could give potential intelligence to avoid unwanted individuals to gain access.\n\n\ud83d\udd3aThis makes blockchain ticketing very appealing for events that have security in mind and want to be able to have stricter control over who gains access to the event.\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/DigityMoon](https://t.me/DigityMoon)\n\n\ud83d\udcc8Tokenomics \ud83d\udcc8\n\nTotal Supply: 800,000,000\n\nMax Hold: 1%\n\nTax: 10\n\n\ud83d\udcb0Anti Dumping \ud83d\udcb0\n\n20% for the first 1st Hour\n\n10% normal taxation (LP and holders)\n\n\ud83d\ude94 Roadmap \ud83d\ude94\n\nPhase 1: Soft Launch\n\n\u2022Fair Launch of Token (No Presale)\n\n\u2022Whitepaper\n\n\u2022Website Launch\n\n\u2022Pancakeswap listing\n\n\u2022Social Media Platforms\n\n\u2022Coinhunt, Coinsniper, Freshcoins applications\n\n\u2022Poocoin Ads\n\n\u2022Coingecko listing\n\n\u2022Community AMA\n\n\u2022Teaser of DigityMoon app (BETA)\n\nPhase 2\n\n\u2022Official Launch of Upgraded Website (V2)\n\n\u2022Launch of DigityMoon Merch / Fundraising NFT's\n\n\u2022DigityMoon BETA release\n\n\u2022Devs and team will doxx\n\n\u2022CMC listing\n\n\u2022Social Media Campaigns\n\n\u2022AMA with a vast audience group\n\nPhase 3:\n\n\u2022Whitebit listing\n\n\u2022Hotbit listing\n\n\u2022Certik Audit\n\n\u2022Marketing campaign commences\n\n\u2022Applications to larger CEX's (TBA)\n\nPhase 4:\n\n\u2022DigityMoon1.0 Official public release\n\n\u2022Much more, to be confirmed.\n\nWhitepaper can be found on the website.\n\n\u2705Links:\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/DigityMoon](https://t.me/DigityMoon)",

    "text": "$CUMINU is worth checking out right now. With Elon\u2019s recent tweet spelling out CUM and his love for $doge we think he may be trying to give us some hints. We have absolutely mooned up to $15M already and we really don\u2019t think this is anywhere near over yet!!\n\nOne of the biggest crypto YouTubers UP NEXT CRYPTO has gone out of his way to make a video on CUMINU! And not only that he has labelled it possibly the next doge coin! (Check at 40 sec) Which is absolutely insane! Cuminu just keeps getting more and more notice! \n\nhttps://youtu.be/Z71h2DiIZho\n\n\nCuminu is planning to make the world first Crypto Pornhub.\n\nEssentially because we are crypto the way models and pornstars will be paid will avoid 20% CGT Costs and CUMINU will take 50% less commission fees then its competitors. Meaning the girls on the platform can earn up to 30% more in revenue. Its a no brainer for them to come onboard, and some big stars are already reaching out.\n\nCheck out the tokenomics further below to understand how the revenue made will be used to burn the Cuminu Tokens and ultimately increase the price of every token circulating making this very attractive for investors.\n\n\n\n- PornHub adverts starts within 24hrs (banners etc)\n\n- CMC: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cuminu/\n\n- $16M valuation\n\n- 90% Liquidity locked 2 years (no rug pull capable)\n\n- No 2%+ big wallets\n\n- Team tokens locked (they own 10%, 50% of that is locked for a month)\n\n- More than 30x until $CUMMIES Cum Rocket market cap.\n\n- Active interest from major influencers in the NSFW space.\n\n- Valid business model which allows us to deliver value to everyone involved\n\n- ETH chain for main coin (stability), BSC for currency (cheap transactions). Fees from tips burned into ETH chain. We charge our stars 50% less than any current platform. (10% versus OnlyFans 20%)\n\n- Some current models on board: Tasha Reign, Lacey London, Blair Williams, Allison Parker, Yvonne Bar, Bonnie Rotten.\n\n- Next model to be announced has 14m+ followers.\n\n- UpNextCrypto and TheCryptoRoom on youtube will be dropping a video on us as soon as theyre done.\n\n- TikTik Promos in the work.\n\n- In negotiations with a Stripper business in LA that owns 50 clubs and bars in vegas to start advertising. (Strippers are another target for the platform for webcam shows etc)\n\n- Current 10k Giveaway is active, twitter influencors to promote it today. As the MC increases more giveaways will happen with larger Prizes.\n\n- Whitepaper / Audit soon\n\n- Aim to get listed on CEX ASAP.\n\n- Team is always working hard to deliver and everything so far has been self-funded by the Dev.\n\nCons:\nThe only real issue currently is the marketing delays which are out of our control as creators have been late so no more specific time frames will be given now to avoid dissapointment.\n\nNeeds people fluent in other languages to help spread the word to non english speakers (chinese, russian etc.)\n\n\nWhat their platform is going to offer:\n\nCams\nIt\u2019s just as the name suggests. Your favourite amateur stars on webcam hosted by $CUMINU. Models will be booked and tipped in $CUMINU tokens. $CUMINU will charge a 10% transaction fee.\n\nContent\nModels will be able to host a profile on $CUMINU that has a range of unlockable content. These will include photos and videos, private message requests and even NFTs.\n\nAma's\nPlans to host fortnightly AMA (ask me anything) with the biggest names in the industry. The sessions will have tiered membership determined by number of $CUMINU in the holder\u2019s wallet. Viewers will be able to purchase $CUMNIU before the AMA and tip the model throughout the session.\n\nTokenomics / Burn\nThey are going to charge 10% on all transactions through the site. Then use those funds to buy back the $CUMINU and burn them. This makes the token deflationary. OnlyFans isn't for all the degens as you have to give ID and hand over your credit card details. Being able to visit these sites and tip in crypto will be a big win. They\u2019re going to auction NFT's of the models during the AMAs. There are some crazy fans out there.\n\nLike the fanboys who buy $1m worth of bella delphines bath water a month. This has the potential to go viral and the AMA's blow up into big events.\n\nRoadmap\nThey reckon mid June for the site to be up and running and host their first AMA after with Tasha Reign soon after.\n\nOutlook\nThis is not financial advice but looks to be an easy moonshot (consider cumrocket). Liquidity locked. Team tokens locked. No whale wallets. Massive stars onboard. They'll use the profits to buy back tokens burning them making this deflationary. Just hold and ride the news highs.\n\n\nFor more information:\n\nWebsite: http://cuminu.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/CumInuToken\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CumInuToken",

Only .5% of supply can be bought or sold at one time, preventing whale dumping or mass buying. There's also a 5 minute cooldown on trades, meaning NO FRONTRUNNER BOTS that fuck up the price. It get's even more interesting though.\n\n**From the DEV AMA:**\n\n*\" The most common question we recieved was about our Anti-Price Dump mechanicism, which is really what make $BuffDoge a unique and revolutionary project! The Anti-Dump mechanism works by calculating the wallet's average cost basis and not allowing the wallet to sell at a loss. This does a few things. First, it attracts buyers who are more willing to hold, rather than day traders looking for a quick flip. In addition it effectively creates continuous price floor levels that the token cannot drop below, preventing panic sell offs that universally affect the rest of the crypto market. Lastly, smart buyers are encouraged to buy up any dip in order to lower their average cost basis.\"*\n\n$BuffDoge can only be bought and sold on Uniswap and can\u2019t be transferred between wallets. If your wallet\u2019s average cost basis is higher than the current price, that means\u00a0**you\u2019ve got diamond hands**. You CANNOT sell for a LOSS. This will prevent any large panic sell offs by essentially creating price floors that will stop mass selling. It's genius. This ALSO incentivizes people to buy more during the dips to reduce their average cost basis and sell sooner if they wish.\n\nAnd FINALLY, the redistribution. If the all-time high hasn\u2019t increased by at least\u00a020\\*\\*% in one week\\*\\*, the liquidity pool is unlocked, and the remaining holders can turn in their tokens for their share of the liquidity pool. This encourages people to hold no matter what if they want a stake of the LP at the all time high.\n\nTHIS IS REVOLUTIONARY. DON'T MISS OUT ON THIS.

As it stands right now the opportunities people see for maximum or instant turnover is getting in early on new projects.  \n   \nAt the same time, these investors are exposed to the highest risk of getting wiped out by bots, scammed by honey-pots, rug pulls, coordinated team token dumping and a lot of other devious tactics.  \n   \nTo avoid this today an inventory must check multiple websites, search for vulnerabilities in code, understand tokenomics and collate all the data together in order to make a decision.   \n   \nThat\u2019s simply too difficult for the majority of us and is a major issue that we need to resolve before we truly can make the crypto sphere feel safe for the general public and gain mainstream adoption. Anyone who solves or helps bring new innovative solutions to this issue is in my opinion, sitting on a potential goldmine.  \n \n\n# That\u2019s where MoonRetriever comes in.\n\n$FETCH is the operating asset of the MoonRetriever Project, the first-ever DEFI project on Binance Smart Chain that serves as a crypto risk assessment platform aiming to help people find safe investments, by bringing an array of features together,\n\n  \n\ud83e\uddb4 **No Rug Pulls From Now On**\n\nA solid multi-featured rug-check system is in place to invest safely.  \n\n\n\ud83e\uddb4 **Never Miss Important Transactions**\n\nTrack specific wallets and keep a close eye on burn and developer wallets.

Through our protocol, Coco Swap aims to offer lower fees and fast swapping than the current platforms. \ud83d\ude80\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nCoco Swap project started in March and it is listed on Pancakeswap in May. Right now all the community seems to be organic, they didn't boost the Telegram channel, their Twitter account is grown organic. BSC Scan Explorer seems to have verified them and added the their logo including the social networks. CoinMarketCap also listed them like 5 days ago, so the project seems to be pushing forward. The main purpose behind Coco Swap Token is to offer a decentralized transactions network token that operates on the Binance (BSC) services.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nFor liquidity holders, Coco Swap seems to offer a good deal where 2% goes to shareholders. The liquidity is not locked, meaning that shareholders can withdraw at any given time, which gives more security towards the project. Their token is deflatory, so as the supply decreases, the scarcity of the token increases.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nAbove I'll list some links where you can check the project: \n\n\ud83d\udcbb Coco Swap website: https://coco-swap.finance/\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Telegram: https://t.me/cocoswapofficial\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Twitter: https://twitter.com/coco_swap\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Pancakeswap link: https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?0xbb4cdb9cbd36b01bd1cbaebf2de08d9173bc095c&outputCurrency=0x9aa6fc71aed1130dee06a91a487bf5ea481de80d\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2705 CoinMarketCap listing: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/coco-swap/\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2705 BSCScan explorer:https://bscscan.com/token/0x9aa6fc71aed1130dee06a91a487bf5ea481de80d\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;",

    "text": "   The time has come for a new coin and exchange, $WINNOW. The domain is claimed and we wanted to invite people to share ideas and hype for early referral awards.\n\nSo what exactly is the coin behind the scenes, WinNow?\n\n   WinNow has one of the fastest growing communities of hodlers in crypto, and now is announcing an airdrop giveaway currently valued at over $100k, the details of which are on their Telegram. The token is soon to be listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. In addition, you can also now track your WinNow value through your TrustWallet, no custom token entry needed! WinNow's social outreach is also growing and it is undoubtable that this is going far given the community behind it, many of whom built SafeMoon into what it has become! The devs and the community have been working overtime to scale up this project big time. It began as simply an idea and has grown into a dedicated community of hard working individuals looking to make a mark in the crypto-space by creating a community by the holders for the holders.\n\n   WinNow is a decentralized token that runs on the Binance Smart Chain. WinNow offers two main utilities including burn and redistribution as incentives for its holders, each at 4% per transaction. WinNow is designed for the community, by the community, to engage and have fun with one another.\n\n   Tokenomics: Total Supply: 1 Trillion Presale price (min 0.1, max 1): 1 bnb = 13.5 Billion. Pancakeswap listing price: 1 bnb = 11 Billion. Liquidity Lock: 3 months Initially burned: 29%\n\n4% Burn 4% Redistribution to all WinNow token holders\n\n   As a team, they\u2019ve branded themselves in such a way that endless opportunities can be created. With the individuals we have and their field of expertise, together, we will all fly to the sky and beyond! They believe that the community they create depends on the positive actions of all of us. The participation and enjoyment of each member is something we value more than anything. So come join the community and hodl!\n\nWe also are community driven, the more the merrier and the more we all make.  WinNow is about winning, and who doesn\u2019t want to win?!\n\n   Seriously, the goal is to become the next pancakeswap, but it starts with you. It starts with us. \n\n   This is a V2 liquidity farm, BEP20 token and there is more to look forward to than other projects.  To get started, we want to focus on the community by making the advertising community driven beyond just referrals.  If you have ideas for banners, catch phrases, or even marketing campaigns will be rewarded with $WINNOW by community vote on our discord server.\n\n   So what to do when joining the community?\n\n   Say hi! Drop in general and give a warm welcome to get things started. This is a growing community for the next big DEFI AMM and we want to make sure everyone feels welcome and can meet the devs!\n\nWhat to expect over the next few weeks and months:\n\nOne week:\n\nLaunch of website \n\nSet up Telegram and Twitter posting campaigns\n\nDaily Giveaways\n\nInitial emission rates\n\nOne Month:\n\nPersonalized AMM for WINNOW\n\nFull audits by Techrate and Certik\n\nFull Medium and Doc page setups for references\n\nCash injections from giveaways\n\nLottery implementation\n\nLottery?  Yes lottery! We want this to be a fun experience beyond just a liquidity farm, and there\u2019s so much more to come!  \n\nSome key information:\n\n\\-200 coins/block\n\n\\-High APR\n\n\\-Active dev support.\n\n\\-AMM coming soon on site\n\n\\-DAILY giveaways of $WINNOW\n\n\\-6% referral bonus on all rewards\n\nYou can read more and join the community for more on our discord, discord.gg/rNwNC9ey\n\nLet us know your thoughts!",

Bigger most coins released before ours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n That is crazy to set such a high goal at an early stage like this. But heres why it might actually work\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Dedicated and educated admins/team. Our whole team has worked on several massive projects in the past. They have all come together to try create there own token and make it as big as the ones they've worked on. Not only will they not stop until this is true, but they have insider knowledge that most people dont !\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Marketers take everything one step further ! Not only have they started working on custom videos for this coin, but they will also try to post poocoin ads up shortly. This will make our coin stand out even further.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Unique contract. Most coins/tokens create a contract with no care. Us however is different. Our unique contract was created to prevent not only whales from buying (Max Buy) but its also anti-bots. Most tokens dont have this feature ! This one does !\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeatures :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost of the features have been stated above, but we have even more here :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- We will launch with proof of locked liquidty and renounced ownership BEFORE launch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Fair launch, no presalers have taken part beforehand.

An investment in Aquari is an investment in the creation of an actual Environmental Conservation Organization.\n\n\ud83c\udf0aAquari aims to become the world's first Environmental Conservation DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). The goal of this project is that 3% of each trade will go to a donation wallet which will then be used to raise money to help create the Aquari Environmental Conservation Organization. This organization will then mobilize all of its resources to achieve the goal of removing manmade pollution from every body of water on the planet.\n\nDevs are fully doxxed and do weekly twitch AMA's. You can find the Linkedin Profiles of each Dev on their website. The developers are fully committed to the cause and are active on telegram everyday. Be sure to read the White-Paper to see how this project could potentially revolutionize how we as a society choose to finance Environmental Conservation Efforts.\n\nAquari's smart contract was carefully designed to ensure project longevity whilst remaining profitable for investors. Raised capital generated from a percentage of the coin's transaction fees directly contributes to the purchasing of Equipment, Specialists, and Laborers all dedicated to the cause of restoring Earth's polluted bodies of water. This makes Aquari a safe and highly profitable investment as the value of the coin is directly tied to the value of work that the Aquari organization provides through cleaning the planet.\n\nEach transaction will be taxed for 10% of its total value. Tax will be divided into: 4% that will be burned to generate and provide liquidity to pancakeswap; 3% that will be redistributed amongst all Aquari holders; 3% that will be sent to a donation wallet to finance the Aquari Non-Profit Organization\u2019s efforts.\n\nLiquidity pool tokens will be sent to the time locked wallet making the coin un-ruggable. LP will be locked for 1 month after which it will be needed to provide liquidity support for centralised exchanges and after it is no longer needed for that purpose, it will be locked again until the next planned listing. 4% of the initial supply will also be sent to the dev wallet that will be used to cover all expenses related to marketing, influencer payments, listing fees, and additional liquidity support if the LP pool is not big enough during the creation of the Aquari Organization.\n\nIn order to make donations the Aquari team will have to withdraw assets from the donation wallet. Assets will be withdrawn in small daily batches to ensure Aquari\u2019s price stability.\n\n\u200b\n\nToken Name: Aquari\n\nSymbol: $AQUARI\n\nContract: 0x6500197a2488610aca288fd8e2dfe88ec99e596c\n\nLINKS \ud83e\udd5e\n [Pancakeswap](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x6500197a2488610aca288fd8e2dfe88ec99e596c) 11-15% slippage\n\n\ud83d\udcdd [Whitepaper](http://aquari.io/downloads/aquari_whitepaper_official.pdf)\n\n\ud83c\udf10 [Website](https://aquari.io/)\n\n\ud83d\udcac [Telegram](https://t.me/aquariofficial)\n\n\ud83d\udc24 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AquariOfficial)\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/aquariofficial) (Weekly AMA's)",

The ownership is renounced \\[The developer has no control over the coin, the only control he has is the on the advertisement - he cannot make any change to the contract or even touch the liquidity\\]\n\nHere are some proofs of this:\n\nContract:\n\n0x5ABd99D200fb4230799B23DE683d25F8CC7d16ba\n\nBurned Liquidity:\n\n[https://bscscan.com/tx/0x148d2e23d5c4e33d9fdebd9dca7c599ad6a1b6132b1d445a0a64fadf6626c663](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x148d2e23d5c4e33d9fdebd9dca7c599ad6a1b6132b1d445a0a64fadf6626c663)\n\nRenounced Ownership:\n\n[https://bscscan.com/tx/0x04c457c74d6cf0c27204fb15d823febc40a35e1138be4c1d06b00f7c48a0b93e](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x04c457c74d6cf0c27204fb15d823febc40a35e1138be4c1d06b00f7c48a0b93e)\n\nThese two points in itself are a really good reason as to why you should buy into this coin, it is pretty much a risk free investment if you catch it under 50k Marketcap as these coins can fly past that in minutes. Me personally I buy in under $10k market cap - which is what I\u2019ve done here so that my minimum returns will be of 10x from here as this project easily has the potential to reach a $100k Marketcap especially with a developer as dedicated as the one on this project and a great community of holders behind him!\n\nAnyways, enough of the jibber jabber from me, here are some links you guys may find useful:\n\nTelegram:\n\n[https://t.me/vodacoinchat](https://t.me/vodacoinchat)\n\nWebsite:\n\n[VodaCoin.pro](https://vodacoin.pro/)\n\nAlso do remember guys, I am not a financial advisor, always do your own research - I\u2019ve left a few links so you are able to research into the coin :slight\\_smile:\n\nTake care guys! Invest wisely - this is the one!",

    "text": "I would like to introduce you to a new token called Shenlong. Shenlong is a token, that I have come across per coincidence and after some quick research, I decided to get into it. This Token is one of many with the charity-purpose, but since there are so many charities for dog shelters etc., they decided it's time to help the children (especially the ones living in poverty).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShenlong is barely a week old and managed to do an x20 in its first week. There is currently an x100 potential, since the market cap is still relatively low. And don't worry about whales, we don't have massive whales that are able to crash this token to the ground! (And look at that website design, it's so clean!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI quote: \"According to UNICEF, there are over 140 million orphans worldwide. In the U.S. alone, over 11 million children live in absolute poverty.\" This is were Shenlong comes in. We as a community want to change this and we believe, that the crypto community is able to do it! Donations towards organizations that take care of children in poverty, ones providing them with presents on holidays, and so on - we want them to witness the good side of the world and humanity!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow to the part why I believe in Shenlong: I have participated in countless fair launches and have witnessed - as many others - many failures, that died after several hours. But Shenlong is different - it has its ups and downs (the ups were huge lol) and still manages to bring in profits for the ones, that are in for the money. The community loves tackling problems, dips, etc. Kudos to the admins and community!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u26a1 Renounced ownership! Forever!  \n\n\ud83d\udd12 LP Locked for 5 years!

    "text": "**Website**: https://elysiumtoken.live\n\n**Etherscan**: https://etherscan.io/token/0x9be485c694494321097ec8949f88489e1d7e214c\n\n**Dextools** : https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0xdcd9d608bf0e221fcad9918d7df9363a6199c717\n\nI'll start off by explaining how I found this token. I have been looking at the Gamestop ethereum address for the past week to see what coins would be sent to them. Most of them were complete shit but this coin, Elysium, was different. It was the only coin on that list that actually had a website (https://elysiumtoken.live). I aped in the moment I saw they had a website and back then they were only at like 4 holders. Currently they are at 49 holders. This coin is a layer 2 oracle service that could be competition to Chainlink in the future. They have a legit dev team with many years of experience, and liquidity is also locked further confirming that this is a solid and legit project. On their roadmap you can see that marketing hasn't even started yet. In my opinion this is a guaranteed moonshot and I still can't believe I bought in so early. I'm excited to see what comes out of this project.\n\n**Why this coin has moonshot potential**\n\n-    An Oracle service with only 49 holders? wtf?\n\n-    Real fundamentals\n\n-    Crazy low market cap\n\n-    Liquidity is locked (meaning this is likely a real project)\n\n-   Has a real dev team with years of experience\n\n-    Marketing hasn't started yet, and will likely start with the platform launch on 6/5\n\n-    Not a BSC shitcoin, this coin is on Ethereum\n\n\nThis feels like a legitimate moonshot waiting to happen, and with a marketcap this low throwing in 0.1 eth might not be a bad idea.  Do your own research though, this is not financial advice.",

    "text": "\ud83d\ude80Welcome To MatiCat\ud83d\ude80\n\nMATICAT ($MCAT) is a community-focused cryptocurrency with instant rewards for holders on the Matic Blockchain! \n\nIt launched on Quickswap 2 days ago. Marketcap is only $150k so a lot of room to grow and already more than 380 holders\n\nWhy I believe it\u2019s a moonshot?\n\nPolygon (Matic) has been growing like crazy in the past few months. The hype is there and no one can ignore it. Just like we saw the BSC craze with thousands of new projects coming out every minute, I expect the same for Matic in the coming months. I believe early meme tokens on Matic will do super well because it\u2019s still early, it\u2019s easier to stand out and investors in Matic are eager to spend some of their coins into those meme token.\n\nWhy MatiCat? \n\nI believe MatiCat compared to other meme coins will do well for a few reasons. First, they website looks pretty nice, they have a really good designer in the team so you can expect great marketing in the future. They are finalizing deals with top influencers, carefully crafting their marketing plan to make sure there is a constant growth. Finally, the team is cool and really trustworthy. LP (88% of the supply) are locked on DxSale for 2 years. Ownership has been renounced. \n\n\nInstant Rewards \nFor every transaction (buy or sell), 1% of the transaction is distributed to existing holders. That means you earn $MCAT just by holding it in your wallet.\n\nSelf-Growing Liquidity \n4% of every transaction is automatically added to the QuickSwap liquidity pool making the project more attractive for future investors.\n\nAnti-whale + Anti-bot\nThere is a maximum transaction amount of 1,000,000 MCAT (1% of total supply) per transaction.\n\nUnique Meme Contest\n2% of the supply is allocated to a community fund to organize weekly Meme Contest. What they call Battles. They are targetting existing memes (only animals) and members are invited to create Memes featuring both tokens avatar.\n\n\ud83e\udd5eContract Address: 0xC8E022CAf0eCB87cED09989d97947F4a1f61cE73\n\nLinks\u2b07\ufe0f\n\nWebsite: https://www.maticat.finance\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/maticat_finance\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/maticat_finance",

While at the same time, millionaires and billionaires have been created by posting their own adult entertainment on popular media site onlyfans, grabbing world-wide attention.

This will go to the moon, with time and patience, and a strong community.\n\nTheir plans for advertisement are also extremely good as they have already got influencers on board and plan to get much larger ones within the space of the next few weeks.

    "text": "\ud83c\udf35Welcome to $TequilaParty!\n\nI asked the dev for an overview and he sent me this:\n\nSo, I created the project initially because I was tired of seemingly ENDLESS rugs on BSC - there was a glaring lack of GOOD projects on Smart Chain. It was really quite simple at first. As our community began to grow, we started talking about what was possible, and the one thing you\u2019ll notice in our telegram is that it\u2019s not an endless stream of the same GIFs you see over and over everywhere else. There are also a distinct lack of \u2018Moonbois\u2019 - people understand that this is a long term hold, and they can see the future. \n\nThe project developed into building a bridge from the real world to what I call the Cryptosphere. In our own crypto world, I think it can sometimes become an echo chamber of sorts, meaning that we all listen to each other and it does very little to advance what Crypto can do and how it will become part of our everyday lives. We decided to do this initially with making our own Tequila. I have deep roots in the distilled spirits world, and know it well, and so we started talking to distilleries in Mexico (as Tequila can only legally be made in Mexico). That is moving along nicely, but we wanted to do more. \n\nWe moved to wanting to attach a NFT to each bottle sold - not to just build a NFT platform like other meme coins searching for purpose, but to really accomplish something. So the idea is this: We\u2019ll commission Mexican artists to design a piece that goes with each bottle; they\u2019ll be very limited editions of artwork. With the sale of the bottle, the NFT is minted, or created, and the contract has a built-in tax - a small percentage (2%) will go to the artist who created the piece. A larger percentage, 8%, will go to the charity or non profit the Artist originally designated. This is all done automatically via SmartContract. We expect taht these NFTs could be traded and resold and collected, and with each subsequent transfer, it\u2019s not a one-time donation to this artist or charity, but perpetual, which we hope will make a major difference in their lives. \n\nThis is, to our knowledge, the very first Crypto-focused tequila. We\u2019ll initially sell it in the United States, the UK, and Hong Kong, as we have connections in those places, with other markets to follow on when production can keep up. \n\nOur major hurdles are regulatory in nature, but it\u2019s a matter of getting through them and securing distribution deals, of which we\u2019ve made great progress.\n\nThe coin started with a very simple brand. I\u2019m not a designer, and did all of the work myself, so you can imagine it wasn\u2019t of top quality that reflects a project like this. What we did have going for us was an incredibly strong community that kept putting out ideas, talking to people about what we\u2019re doing, and encouraging progress and forward movement. Many of our community members have contributed liquidity, further strengthening the project and ensuring our ultimate success. We\u2019ve started working with a top design firm on our branding and identity, because we want the brand to transcend, a bridge again, the cryptosphere and the real world. The bottle needs to look good on shelves at restaurants/bars/liquor stores, and be recognizeable in the crypto space. \n\nThe key difference between TequilaParty and others is that we\u2019re pursuing a more traditional PR strategy to spread awareness of what we\u2019re doing and the artists/non profit organizations we choose to support. This major marketing push will really start to happen once we\u2019ve finalized and settled on our identity, which I expect to happen in the next couple days (we\u2019ve been at it for two weeks now, out of our three weeks of existence). \n\nThe future for TequilaParty? We\u2019re an international Tequila brand that helps make the world a better place.\n\nWe celebrate traditional Mexican art, conservation of traditional, sustainable agricultural techniques, and help people who aren\u2019t all the way in the cryptosphere or curious about crypto get their hands on what will possibly be their very first cryptographic token. Which is super cool. We build bridges.\n\nRevenue from Tequila sales, in addition to supporting our artist and non-profit partners, will flow back into the $tequila token in the form of a regularly structured dividend, adding constant price pressure to it. TequilaParty has an incredibly bright future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83c\udf35 $Tequila on the moon!\n\nSocial Media:\n\nWebsite: [tequilaparty.space](https://tequilaparty.space)\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/tequilaparty](https://t.me/tequilaparty)\n\nTwitter: u/TequilaPartyBsc\n\nBuy on Pancake Swap - \\[[https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xf459693e9f45f432ecb48afe1bd0ccaa4ad82959](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xf459693e9f45f432ecb48afe1bd0ccaa4ad82959)\\]([https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xf459693e9f45f432ecb48afe1bd0ccaa4ad82959](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xf459693e9f45f432ecb48afe1bd0ccaa4ad82959))\n\nTokenomics\n\n\\\\-Contract: 0xf459693e9f45f432eCB48afE1bD0cCaA4ad82959\n\n\\\\-Symbol : Tequilaparty\n\n\\\\-Max Supply: 1,000,000,000,000\n\n\\\\-Pancakeswap Liquidity: \n\n\\\\-Marketing: 20%\n\n\\\\-2% Tax, redistributed to holders",

      "There's so much to be said for this amazing offering on the BSC. Tequila Party is something that is hard for a lot of  us to imagine - a legitimate, community driven, charity supporting blockchain project with a real traditionally produced Tequila that will be marketed with an NFT compliment. I was new to the BSC coming from purely ERC20 offerings and I have never felt the same ownership as my small bag in Tequila Party.\n\nJameson and the development team are open, honest, and engaged with the Telegram group - they welcome feedback and share progress with the group as well as answer questions and even share important tidbits of history as well as personal photos from travel and experiences. \n\nIt's a unique opportunity to invest in something with the goal being long term sustainable growth both for the investors and the team as well as the artists and charities through the transfer and resell of associated NFTs bringing long term stability and income to indigenous families helping to preserve centuries old tradition.\n\nInvestors are likely to see results in the form of growing value as well as walking into the store one day and being able to snag a bottle of Tequila they may have had a hand in producing through collaboration and feedback. I have been in the group for a couple weeks and am completely impressed by the community - no toxic memes or high pressure, just committed people working to a project that can bring much needed support to families in need and reward the hard work and dedication of a time honored craft.\n\nTequila party is definitely worth a shot, maybe two or three!",
      "I'll try to keep it short. I'm selective of my cryptos and have been around for more than 7 years now. Hence, my handle Lexidoge.  \n  \nI can vouch that Jameson himself is very active on Telegram. He clearly is very passionate about his project and he takes the time to answer all the questions and has been doing his hardest to push for the project and even shows us bits and pieces of his life. He very much reminds me of Vechain's Sunny Lu during the very early stages of the process. Never seen a dev as active and as transparent as him. Look up his social media pages. Stalk him if you'd like. Don't be a creep though. XD\n  \n \nI'm sure you all can read the post/go on the website and read about the future partnerships and actual product that will be released but let me focus on something else: the community.\n  \nFrom the dev and his team itself and to the holders, there really is a strong sense of community that really believes in the project.   \n  \nNo one is really pressured to invest more than they can, of course we all want to price to go up and have it x100 eventually, but the general atmosphere is that it's the product first. Despite being a microcap, the team itself isn't focused on quick pumps. They really care just pushing for organic growth and slowly getting the word out through strategic marketing and community feedback. While also giving if updated on product development.\n  \nWill this x100 overnight? No it won't. But it's not going to be a rug pull and before the year ends, I can say that you'd be amazed at the organic growth that has happened for Tequila as a whole. Not just the price.",
      "This one is still so undervalued. They have a real, true purpose and a dedicated team. This is not a pump and dump coin, it\u2019s a world changing project with a creative and supportive community.",
      "How would you like to invest in a crypto that's not susceptible to the whim of a Twitter-happy self-characterized demigod? Or a quality tequila that's worth enjoying? Well this is the project that combines the two. TequilaParty will transcend the highly susceptible dependency on other crypto currencies because it's going to be backed my a retail product: Tequila with an NFT that gives back to the crypto community, charities, artists who's works will adorn the packaging, and the Mexican community producing the product.\n\nIt's highly undervalued because we just stood up a couple weeks ago. The project is moving on par with the forecasted schedule, and the dev team is completely accessible and transparent. Now, as others have said, the community is first rate. They're supportive of each other and the welcoming to the newcomers. In fact, each gets a personal welcome from either Jameson or the moderators. You have a chance to invest in a project that's going to produce profit for you. For all of us. It's all in the plan that's already published. \n\nThe team is truly global and respectful of each other's opinions. The community is an active participant in shaping this project. The best part... It doesn't matter how much of how little you own! It's like being an investor in a startup because it is. Come check us out on Telegram and https://Tequilaparty[.]space. \n\nTequilaParty: Everyone's Welcome.",

    "title": "UltraSafe Just Reached 36k+ Holders - Marketing & multiple CeX listings underway, already listed on CG and CMC",
    "text": "Hey UltraArmy!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst & foremost I would like to invite you to join 36,000+ holders in this wonderful token of the future. Lets face it, markets have been scary recently. With fear at an all time high, it has never been easier to pick your next investment. Why? Well it's simple. Investing into a coin marketing off of security & safety is more brilliant than ever. Simple right? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUltraSafe is fully rug-proof. UltraSafe has its liquidity locked for 79 years, its contract ownership has been renounced, & two official audits completed by Solidity & Certik. With an aim to complete a third audit down the line we are truly in line to being the safest most secure coin on the market. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, why should you invest? Let\u2019s think about current trends in crypto. A great example here is SafeMoon. SafeMoon has its success attributed to selling the idea of safety. But, SafeMoon isn\u2019t as safe as it\u2019s all cracked up to be. A quick comparison of audits show huge vulnerabilities in SafeMoon which have been corrected in UltraSafe. We are here to put the product behind the name. With 2 audits completed showing higher safety ratings then SafeMoon, we think you\u2019ll agree that we are where your investment should be. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere for tokenomics? Ultrasafe is unique in that it allows for 4% of every transaction to be distributed to the liquidity pool while reflecting another 4% to holders. This helps consistently reduce the impact that selling has on our coin while rewarding those who hold. 8% tax helps to secure longer investments from whales as well as avoid standard pump & dumps. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat's making me most bullish about this coin? Well, honestly the team is incredibly well connected. Coingecko listing at launch & an audit already completed alone is unheard of. Lbank, CerTik, CMC, Banners, Planes & Broadway Times Square Billboard in 2 weeks? No worries there. We now have confirmed a 8.8m TikTok follower in the works. Incredible. This team has smashed every record the scene & BSC currently offer & plan to continue to bullrun right up to the top. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nConsistently updated WhitePaper with clear goals & wonderfully thought out vaults focused around marketing, it is clear they know what they are doing. Plans are clearly actively working to put this coin to the top. With recent movements like ones they just secured with TritomBux where you can earn coins, UltraSafe is just getting started.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe community is strong, connected & engaging to say the least. With new Exchanges in the works nearly every Catalyst still remains. The team has shown amazing transparency regarding marketing money, so you know what's going on while they consistently follow through with their incredible roadmap to success. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe team has doxxed themselves by showing their faces & names during both AMA\u2019s. Future full dox has been planned while currently some staff are doxed fully on their website. It is worth noting to be listed to any CEX or on CoinGeck/CMC you must be fully doxed to their team. So while a full public dox isn\u2019t currently available the team is fully doxed to the proper entities needed for liability. With that being the case, an LLC that is required for other CEX listings is near completion. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are many incredible plans down the line for UltraSafe. With multiple things in the works, including: dApp, NFTs, UltraWallet, UltraSafe Exchange, merchandise store, CEX listings(already in talks with 3 more currently), More AMA\u2019s, Influencer & Social Media oriented marketing, Billboards, Planes, Times Square, outsourced & animated Website v3 & major news articles this team has a lot going for it. Don\u2019t be surprised to hear even more soon as these come to fruition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe\u2019ve had some large holders, but \u201cBig Whale Randall\u201d, a successful crypto investor, takes the cake. Currently our largest holder, \u201cRandall\u201d had invested 500k towards the beginning of our second week into our project & has assured investors he is here for the long run! The community saw this as an amazing sign of faith in such an early project. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith so many options to consider UltraSafe makes it easier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith higher growth than standard savings accounts there is no smarter place to park your money. It is currently an amazing entry point as we ride strong momentum along with the crypto recovery. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe hope to see you join the UltraArmy while making your safest investment yet!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nImportant Links:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite: [https://ultrasafe.finance/](https://ultrasafe.finance/)\n\nCoinMarketCap: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ultrasafe/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ultrasafe/)\n\nSolidity: [https://solidity.finance/audits/UltraSafe/](https://solidity.finance/audits/UltraSafe/)\n\nCertik: [https://www.certik.org/projects/ultrasafe](https://www.certik.org/projects/ultrasafe)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.gg/hy54dHhjvk](https://discord.gg/hy54dHhjvk)\n\nTwitter: [https://mobile.twitter.com/ultrasafebsc](https://mobile.twitter.com/ultrasafebsc)\n\nTeleGram: [https://t.me/UltraSafeOfficial](https://t.me/UltraSafeOfficial)\n\nReddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultrasafe/](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/Ultrasafe/)\n\nBscScan: [https://bscscan.com/token/0x0b3f42481C228F70756DbFA0309d3ddC2a5e0F6a](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0b3f42481C228F70756DbFA0309d3ddC2a5e0F6a)\n\nFaceBook: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/503406880704284/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/503406880704284/)\n\nStockTwits: [https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ULTRASAFE.X](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ULTRASAFE.X)\n\nMost Recent AMA: [https://m.twitch.tv/videos/1036054617](https://m.twitch.tv/videos/1036054617)\n\nFirst Live AMA: [https://youtu.be/FcyQYBk4wU4](https://youtu.be/FcyQYBk4wU4)\n\nCoinGecko Listing: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ultrasafe](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ultrasafe)\n\nDexTools: [https://www.dextools.io/app/pancakeswap/pair-explorer/0x48bac97d5e3116626a56704be7399e1cb593a945](https://www.dextools.io/app/pancakeswap/pair-explorer/0x48bac97d5e3116626a56704be7399e1cb593a945)",

    "title": "DxSale $SALE. Literally the most undervalued project in crypto a Launchpad with SEVEN Chains already integrated. 6-10million in revenue. Over 5,000 attempted launches and is at 4m MC. Trading -4x earnings HOW? No marketing, get in before they start and people realize.",
    "text": "**What is DxSale?**\n\nDxSale $SALE is a blockchain agnostic decentralized launchpad where anyone can launch their new project and the Devs have little to no control over launches. DxSale\u2019s goal is unlike other launchpads in that they are not a curated launchpad (no vetting of tokens being launched) and do not require the developers launching the project, or buyers of potential projects to hold $SALE to participate. On it\u2019s face this appears as a negative as it doesn\u2019t incentivize holding the token. However it aligns with their goal, to be a decentralized launchpad where anyone can participate and prospective investors are responsible for doing their own research. \n\nThey also have DxLocker which is another product on their platform where anyone can lock their tokens (similar to unicrypt), so devs can lock tokens on a vesting schedule, liquidity tokens can be locked, and if you wanted to prevent yourself from panic selling you could even lock your own tokens for a .1 BNB Fee. They also have plans to create farming and NFT platforms in the future, talked with dev recently and said they are working on NFT tools \u2018never seen in the industry\u2019. \n\n\nDxLaunch \u2013 IDO Launchpad\n\nDxLocker \u2013 Token locker where projects can lock team tokens, liquidity tokens are automatically locked after presale with Dev setting time, viewable prior.  \n\nDxNFT \u2013 Coming Q4\n\nDxFarm \u2013 Coming Q4\n\n**Chains**\n\nCurrently they have the following networks available on their platform available for IDOs and available to utilize DxLocker.\n\n\n\u2022\tEthereum \u2013 Feb 24th\n\n\u2022\tBinance Smart Chain \u2013 Feb 24th\n\n\u2022\tMatic/Polygon \u2013 March 9th\n\n\u2022\tAvalanche \u2013 Added May 26th\n\n\u2022\tFantom \u2013 Added May 26th\n\n\u2022\tHarmony \u2013 Added May 26th\n\n\u2022\txDai \u2013 Added May 26th\n\n**Why Buy now?**\n\nThe Devs are now implementing a Buy and burn model. What this means is fees generated by the platform will be used to buy the SALE token. These tokens will then be burnt. In effect for holders of the token this has a similar price impact as you would by airdropping, but it takes away the risk of stakers dumping on every airdrop in addition to bypassing the entire staking model. In addition, this helps the price for holders in two ways:\n\na.\tThe initial buy increases the price of the token\n\nb.\tThose tokens are then burned decreasing the supply\n\nLaunches\nThere are two parts of the launchpad standard token launch or DeFi launches. Standard token launches are pre-defined contracts where DxSale retains ownership of the contract and compare to the DeFi launchpad are relatively safe. The action however is really going on in the DeFi launchpad. This is where anyone can launch their DeFi project and where we seen SafeMoon etc. launch. They can emergency cancel launches at certain points but the general gist is DYOR. When Binance smart chain launched. The devs implemented BSC onto their platform in a little over 2 weeks (Devs are great and why I am invested in their token). This platform has exploded they have had over 3,000 projects attempted launch with about 1,000 being successful. This is where things get interesting. \n\nDxSale's cut\nDxSale takes a cut of every presale with a fee to list (.6 BNB) and they take a portion of every presale launch\u2019s revenue (2%), and a portion of their tokens (2%). \n\n\n**Revenue:**\nIts hard to estimate how much revenue is generated particularly due to \u2018portion of tokens\u2019 amount as that needs to be sold manually (automation where holders decide when to sell is in progress). For example a token called \u2018ghostface\u2019 launched on the platform last week. The coin mooned hard and DxSale had $700,000 worth of the token before selling $100,000. That is from one token. In a telegram group of fellow investors we have calculated before by combing throughout the wallets revenue has been anywhere from 5-10 million in three months. Which from a valuation perspective the tokens marketcap is under earnings which of course is insane. \n\nHere is one of the wallets reserved for buy and burn with $1,300,000 dollars: 0x91c6349907f47af037999ab501051835006ef7bf. There are a few other wallets associated as well, in total there should be around 2million dollars just for buying and burning the token available. \n \n\n\n**Roadmap:**\n(Needs updating). The whole front site needs to be updated detailing buy and burn model and newer roadmap. I am working right now on getting an answer from when that is happening. However, from talking with devs and reading all announcements I will list the short-term roadmap below with the longterm roadmap still being valid (NFT tools and farming coming Q4 etc.) \n\n1.\tBSC Bridge \n\n\u2013 The token right now is available on bother Ethereum and BSC. There is however a price discrepancy. This will be mitigated when the bridge launches which will allow easy arbitrage and stabilize the price between the two. They have partnered with ChainLink to implement this. \n\n2.\tDxSaleV3 \u2013 Per Dev Hash this is about 70% done and should be launching within the next month or two. This will bring a host of improvements including:\n\n-\tAutomation of buy and burn model\n\n-\tallowing developers to cancel their own presale will be available as well as anyone can cancel a presale after 2 days of it being \u201cready for finalized\u201d \n\n-\tUpdated UI\n\n-\tOther improvements\n\n-\tImplementation of more chains: In a surprise they randomly dropped 4 new chains last week being available on the platform FTM, xDai, ONE, and AVAX. With more coming. This is one of the main items that has me most excited about the project. Most launchpads you are lucky to get one chain on it, they are able to implement others onto their platform thanks to their development skills at a speed unrivaled by other launchpads.\n\nWebsite: https://dxsale.network/\n\nBuy on Pancake Swap: https://v1exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x97bb08ba41f033beaac315169fc566ac9e0daf52\n\nBuy on Uniswap: https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0xf063fe1ab7a291c5d06a86e14730b00bf24cb589\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/DxSale\n\n\n**Note: I would recommend buying on Uniswap, it is cheaper there. The price discrepancy will be solved once the bridge is launched and arbitrage is easy making price stabilize**",

    "text": "[\u231b](https://emojipedia.org/hourglass-done/) If you are reading this in 'new' on the subreddit, then this token has just launched this exact minute.\n\n**$HODLER, the community coin of the decade. Launching right now.** [\ud83d\ude80](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)\n\n$HODLER is a token designed to show everyone the power of HODLing! This token is made for the Chads, the apes, the diamond handed legends and that guy who held his way to a brand-new Lamborghini. Make your wife's boyfriend proud by hodlin' $HODLER to the moon. Hey maybe this time they will invite you out for dinner when you show them your gains! [\ud83d\udcb8](https://emojipedia.org/money-with-wings/)\n\n*If you want to skip down for the contract address, DYOR links and more, feel free, otherwise here's a summary of the tokens birth.*\n\nThe idea for the token was created by a FairLaunch group who've in the past released daily tokens, to see what works and what doesn't. In attempts to create the perfect BSC Memecoin to take on the giants. The SafeMoons, the Doges, the ApeTokens etc. The groups main goal was to create safe launches in a world where 9/10 coins posted on this subreddit have been scams. This token is for the people, the ones who've fallen victim to Rugpulls, Honey Pots and more. The team has decided to use the specific tokenomics for this coin to promote HODLing, offering shared token tax for every transaction to each holder. Some of the tax also fuels liquidity for life, meaning you can really HODL for as long as you like.\n\nThe token's launch has been promoted throughout the day, and so we can expect the charts to rise pretty quickly into the tokens lifecycle. There is a telegram on this post if you wish to join the community and speak to the dev team personally before you decide to join the HODL mission. There is also a website which will be linked below; it includes their objectives and goals to help achieve the dream of overtaking the giants in this game.\n\n**Contract Links**\n\nPancakeswap: https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xc63313895dfa5574a98d1f7d63968ad32970b0ed\n\nBSC Scan: https://bscscan.com/address/0xc63313895dfa5574a98d1f7d63968ad32970b0ed\n\n**Official Links:**\n\n[\ud83d\udcdf](https://emojipedia.org/pager/)Telegram: https://t.me/hodlerbsc\n\n[\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb](https://emojipedia.org/man-technologist/)Website: https://www.hodlertoken.net/\n\n**Tokenomics:**\n\n[\ud83d\udd25](https://emojipedia.org/fire/)50% Initial Supply Burnt  \n[\ud83d\udcb8](https://emojipedia.org/money-with-wings/)20% LP burned!  \n[\ud83c\udfe6](https://emojipedia.org/bank/)8% to Liquidity Pool  \n[\ud83d\udcb0](https://emojipedia.org/money-bag/)2% to holders  \n[\ud83c\udfe6](https://emojipedia.org/bank/)80% locked liquidity\n\n**They have a roadmap live on their website; they are aiming to HODL to the moon with this one so the earlier you get in the better!

    "text": "Hi, lots of news and exciting developments to update you on with Gold Farm! Rather than writing massive paragraphs and boring everyone, I think that a quick Q+A will be a bit lighter and more effective :D.\n\n**Q: What is new with Gold Farm?**\n\nA: There is a brand spanking new dapp and website and there are a load of farms already up (9) plus a load more incoming (8 announced with more being added every couple of days) also the marketing campaign is ready to start now the dapp is shiny so get in before the rockets are ignited ;).\n\nPartnerships so far: $Feg, $Richie, $Offy, $Trdg, $Bulldog, $Feast, $Hogl, $Shilling, $Knight, $Sex, $Naut, $Rok, $Hmng, $Crypt\u2026. With loads more on the waiting list!\n\nUpdate!! // There will be a new farm everyday for the next 14 days! That's 14 new partners + 14 new communities reached!\n\nPlus of course the fBnB farm and the fEth farm which are already generating great passive income when you deposit $gold.\n\n**Q: What is Gold Farm?**\n\nA: Gold Farm is a farming protocol whereby you deposit a given token to earn 1-3 tokens as rewards with no impermanent loss and no lockup period. For developers, it is a chance to add an additional use case to their tokens and cross-promote different projects. It's a win-win :D.\n\n\u201cThey Make Passive Income Easy\u201d\n\n**Q: Why buy $Gold the Gold Farm native token?**\n\nA: Firstly you can use it to farm various tokens on the platform with new opportunities to farm with it being added all the time. Secondly, you can put it in either fBnB or fEth farms and earn a share of all the fees collected from the other farms. Passive income here we come!\n\n**Q: What is the upside price-wise?**\n\nA: As the Gold Farm team have gone for releasing a working product first followed by hype and marketing (i know its normally the other way round, but this is a plus to me) the market cap on BSC side is only 2.6 million at present, with ETH side being under 2 million! Super farm which has less of a working product has a market cap of 89 million so a x10 from here is a very cautious price prediction!\n\nThere is a circulating supply of only 450,000 on each side and the vast majority of this is already sat in farms.\n\n**Q: Can it scale up?**\n\nA: Coming up on the roadmap is the ability for projects to add their own farms via an automated form. So once this gets going expect hundreds of farms\u2026.. Imagine what this will do to the returns of the fbnb and feth farms!\n\nPlus they have an innovative NFT farming / marketplace feature coming further down the roadmap, just to add even more fuel to that rocket.\n\n**Q: How is Gold Farm going to gain exposure for its product?**\n\nA: Firstly every time a new farm is added Gold Farm is introduced to a new community by the communities leaders themselves. Secondly, there is an ambitious marketing campaign being rolled out based upon Feg tokens marketing campaign who gold farm are exclusively partnered with, this is ready to go and is being initiated as soon as the market stabilizes after the \u2018hiccup\u2019. In addition, Gold Farm is soon being added to FegEx as a priority listing!\n\nUpdate!! // New exchange listing this week! + The button has been pressed on the marketing campaign as of today! Don't sleep on this one \ud83d\ude09\n\n**Q: where can i get more info / buy / ask more questions :D?**\n\nA: [https://goldfarm.io/](https://goldfarm.io/)\n\n**Q: Are my funds safe?**\n\nA: Gold Farm has been audited by the legendary FegRox and also by the reputable auditing firm Solidity. So, yes.\n\nLink here: [https://solidity.finance/audits/GoldFarm/](https://solidity.finance/audits/GoldFarm/)",

This round is going to be big because we're taking new big steps for the marketing. This project sets out to gamify meme tokens by having players invest short-term in order to win prizes in BNB.  (Learn more here: [https://arenacoin.gg/](https://arenacoin.gg/))\n\nNow you may be wondering, where does this prize money come from? Well 10% of every transaction is taxed and goes towards the prize pool. This means that the more people who participate, the larger the prize pool. Our launch prize pool ended up being 12BNB, so imagine if we get 1000s of players, the prize pool can easily turn into 100BNB. (Telegram: [https://t.me/ArenaCoinGG](https://t.me/ArenaCoinGG))\n\nNow you're probably asking yourself, how can I win this money? Well let me describe the possible events that occur during the coin's launch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**King of the Hill \ud83c\udff9**  \nThe person to make the purchase (0.1BNB or more) that get's the token to an ATH (All time high), wins 20% of the prize pool!\n\n**Last One In \ud83c\udff9**  \nAnother 20% of the prize pool would be given to the person who makes the last purchase of 0.1BNB before the rug pull occurs!\n\n**Pop up event \ud83c\udff9**  \nAt a random time during the coin's lifespan, an announcement will be made about an event, persons who've made purchases of 0.1BNB or more 30 minutes - 1 second before this announcement is made (in the Telegram) will be eligible to enter an event where they can win 15% of the prize pool! E.g If Pop up event is announced at 5:30PM, all transactions of 0.05BNB and more that was made at 5:00:00PM to 5:30:00PM are eligible for the event!\n\n**Diamond Hands \ud83c\udff9**  \nThe top 3 holders 30 minutes before the rug pull will receive (10% of prize pool for 1st, 6% for 2nd and 4% for 3rd).\n\n**Whaling \ud83c\udff9**  \nThe person who makes the single largest buy-in of BNB wins 15% of the prize pool!\n\n**Sharpshooter \ud83c\udff9**  \nThe person to purchase 0.1BNB worth in tokens close to a specific time will win 15% of the prize pool. Purchase must be within 10 seconds of the time to be eligible.\n\n**Burn Knuckles \ud83c\udff9**  \nThe first person to transfer a specific amount of tokens to a specific burn address wins 15% of the pot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDepending on the round, a few of these events will show up but King of the Hill and Last One In are permanent events that will appear in every round!\n\nTime left till the round starts is listed on the website!

We don\u2019t perceive ticket forging or resale to an unintended recipient as an issue. The threats associated with the wrong people accessing your event are, unfortunately, known. From sexual harassment to active shooter occurrences, tracing tickets could give potential intelligence to avoid unwanted individuals to gain access.\n\n\ud83d\udd3aThis makes blockchain ticketing very appealing for events that have security in mind and want to be able to have stricter control over who gains access to the event.\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/DigityMoon](https://t.me/DigityMoon)\n\n\ud83d\udcc8Tokenomics \ud83d\udcc8\n\nTotal Supply: 800,000,000\n\nMax Hold: 1%\n\nTax: 10\n\n\ud83d\udcb0Anti Dumping \ud83d\udcb0\n\n20% for the first 1st Hour\n\n10% normal taxation (LP and holders)\n\n\ud83d\ude94 Roadmap \ud83d\ude94\n\nPhase 1: Soft Launch\n\n\u2022Fair Launch of Token (No Presale)\n\n\u2022Whitepaper\n\n\u2022Website Launch\n\n\u2022Pancakeswap listing\n\n\u2022Social Media Platforms\n\n\u2022Coinhunt, Coinsniper, Freshcoins applications\n\n\u2022Poocoin Ads\n\n\u2022Coingecko listing\n\n\u2022Community AMA\n\n\u2022Teaser of DigityMoon app (BETA)\n\nPhase 2\n\n\u2022Official Launch of Upgraded Website (V2)\n\n\u2022Launch of DigityMoon Merch / Fundraising NFT's\n\n\u2022DigityMoon BETA release\n\n\u2022Devs and team will doxx\n\n\u2022CMC listing\n\n\u2022Social Media Campaigns\n\n\u2022AMA with a vast audience group\n\nPhase 3:\n\n\u2022Whitebit listing\n\n\u2022Hotbit listing\n\n\u2022Certik Audit\n\n\u2022Marketing campaign commences\n\n\u2022Applications to larger CEX's (TBA)\n\nPhase 4:\n\n\u2022DigityMoon1.0 Official public release\n\n\u2022Much more, to be confirmed.\n\nWhitepaper can be found on the website.\n\n\u2705Links:\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/DigityMoon](https://t.me/DigityMoon)",

Most of the paper hands have gone and what remains is a dedicated, loyal base of people who love the story but also hate what Sarah and others have done.\n\nRyan is active daily on the telegram, and they are planning an AMA and to develop a roadmap to give the token purpose beyond its initial goal.\n\nCheck out Ryan's crappy website which they've kept as it's so legit - https://www.fckyousarah.com\n\nContract: 0x8a022bbbc9439deff6f021291a12580b354e2df6\n\nPancakeswap: https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x8a022bbbc9439deff6f021291a12580b354e2df6\n\nTelegram: @fuckyousarahtoken\n\nLP was burnt and contract renounced at launch so it's safu.\n\nCome join the fun.\n\nDYOR.",

When people hear about this it speaks for itself, not long before this snowball starts!\n\nThis originally launched about a month ago, but relaunched on a new contract with the liquidity of V1 simply transferred over, on May 17th.\n\nThe devs of this project transferred liquidity without a single hiccup.\n\nMarketing push is coming soon.\n\n**2K+ Holders and Growing by the Minute!**\n\n**NEW WEBSITE** with roadmap, lightpaper, audit, new logo, and more!\n\n[https://only1token.com](https://only1token.com/)\n\nThe community of Only1Token is confident as ever after a migration to PCS V2 liquidity that went off without a single hiccup and no reported issues from holders.\n\nWhile the market is down and so is every single coin, as well as Only 1 Token, the core holders have hardly budged and the confidence in the project and concept is rising.\n\nGetting this token for under $1M, even under $10M is a steal in my opinion.\n\nWith an upcoming marketing push planned- the time is better than ever to get in on a piece of this token. **There's only 1 so don't let someone else take it!** Don't forget about the Portfolio Tracker coming up to add utility!\n\nPortfolio tracker will have a very sleek UI and allow you to see your all of your coins values and trade them with style and ease!\n\nTOKENOMICS\n\n\u261d\ufe0fMax Supply of 1\n\n\u261d\ufe0f7% Transaction Fee\n\n\u261d\ufe0f 4.9% rewarded to holders\n\n\u261d\ufe0f 1.9% added to trading liquidity\n\n\u261d\ufe0f0.2% sent to Project Evolution Fund for Marketing / Future Improvements, this will be totally transparent and will allow us to market into the next stratosphere!\n\n[Staking added as part of V2!](https://only1token.medium.com/preparing-for-the-v2-migration-c1b79e851905)\n\n>As mentioned above, over 25% of the supply of upgraded O1T will be given to the community in the form of LP staking rewards. Anyone who holds O1T will be able to go to the Liquidity section of PancakeSwap V2 and supply equal USD values of BNB and O1T in exchange for Liquidity Pool tokens (LP tokens). LP token holders receive a share of the built in PancakeSwap trading fees as well as a share of the 1.9% liquidity fee AND a share of the 4.9% reflect rewards.\n\n\ud83d\udc21Partnership hasn't been announced yet but there is one coming.\n\nBRAND NEW CONTRACT: 0xBB994E80E2eDc45dCe9065bda73ADc7E9337b64F\n\n\ud83d\udd12Locked Liquidity on dx sale.\n\n\ud83e\udd5ePancake Swap.\n\nYou need to use V2, 7-8% slippage.\n\n\ud83d\udcf1Telegram: Only1Token\n\n**AUDIT BY TECHRATE**: [https://only1token.com/audit.pdf](https://only1token.com/audit.pdf)\n\nMore on the hold to farm from Lightpaper on Medium:\n\n**Hold to farm liquidity:** Inspired by the way the reflection fee works, we set out to devise a way to incorporate the same type of hold-to-earn mechanics as a way to reward LP token holders. This is accomplished very simply by accumulating the 1.9% liquidity fees from every transfer in the token contract and sending them to the liquidity pool on every buy and sell. The amount of tokens awarded to LP token holders is 2.5% of every buy and sell, as long as there are sufficient tokens in the contract to pay the reward. On the release of O1T, 25% of the supply is initially sent to the contract to provide these rewards, and it is sustained by the liquidity fee on every transfer. Since 2.5% of every buy and sell is being rewarded to LP holders, and the liquidity fee is only 1.9% this results in a 0.6% deficit which allows the initial 25% of the supply that is in the contract to slowly enter circulation, until the contract is depleted and the liquidity fee can be reduced to 0%.\n\nWe hope everyone in the community is as excited as we are for the future of O1T as we make history together! It won\u2018t be long before everybody becomes aware that there\u2019s Only 1 Token.",

From sexual harassment to active shooter occurrences, tracing tickets could give potential intelligence to avoid unwanted individuals to gain access.\n\n\ud83d\udd3aThis makes blockchain ticketing very appealing for events that have security in mind and want to be able to have stricter control over who gains access to the event.\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/DigityMoon](https://t.me/DigityMoon)\n\n\ud83d\udcc8Tokenomics \ud83d\udcc8\n\nTotal Supply: 800,000,000\n\nMax Hold: 1%\n\nTax: 10\n\n\ud83d\udcb0Anti Dumping \ud83d\udcb0\n\n20% for the first 1st Hour\n\n10% normal taxation (LP and holders)\n\n\ud83d\ude94 Roadmap \ud83d\ude94\n\nPhase 1: Soft Launch\n\n\u2022Fair Launch of Token (No Presale)\n\n\u2022Whitepaper\n\n\u2022Website Launch\n\n\u2022Pancakeswap listing\n\n\u2022Social Media Platforms\n\n\u2022Coinhunt, Coinsniper, Freshcoins applications\n\n\u2022Poocoin Ads\n\n\u2022Coingecko listing\n\n\u2022Community AMA\n\n\u2022Teaser of DigityMoon app (BETA)\n\nPhase 2\n\n\u2022Official Launch of Upgraded Website (V2)\n\n\u2022Launch of DigityMoon Merch / Fundraising NFT's\n\n\u2022DigityMoon BETA release\n\n\u2022Devs and team will doxx\n\n\u2022CMC listing\n\n\u2022Social Media Campaigns\n\n\u2022AMA with a vast audience group\n\nPhase 3:\n\n\u2022Whitebit listing\n\n\u2022Hotbit listing\n\n\u2022Certik Audit\n\n\u2022Marketing campaign commences\n\n\u2022Applications to larger CEX's (TBA)\n\nPhase 4:\n\n\u2022DigityMoon1.0 Official public release\n\n\u2022Much more, to be confirmed.\n\nWhitepaper can be found on the website.\n\n\u2705Links:\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/DigityMoon](https://t.me/DigityMoon)",

They stuck around and manually refunded each individual user out of their own pocket - something never before seen in the DeFi crypto world!

Melon users can give and receive our cryptocurrency Melons instead of Likes and finally get rewarded in real-time for their creativity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2728Vision:\n\nCreate the first blockchain-based Social Media Platform that will reward original content creators. On The Melon App, we will not be able to exchange Likes with each other, but our cryptocurrency Melon. Each \"Like\" equals one Melon on the app, which goes directly to the content creator. No more annoying ads or different content to spamming our feeds. These Melons can be exchanged to fiat currency in real-time on our application. When you hold Melons, you will receive a constant appreciating amount through our Tokenomics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u26a1\ufe0fTokenomics:\n\nThere will be a total of 50,000,000,000 Melons in Supply, from which we have already burnt 50%. We have chosen a relatively small total supply to grant fair rewards to content creators on their posts with Melons that actually have value.\n\nAdditionally, we have an 8% Fee for every Melon transaction. From that, 5% will be redistributed between all the Melon holders. The other 3% will be burnt and added forever to our automatic Liquidity Pool for the Token. Half of that will be kept in Melons, whereas the other half will immediately be kept in BNB. This ensures constant growth and less volatility. The dev team will keep 2% of the supply in the marketing & development wallet, locked for one month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2696\ufe0f Fair DxSale Launch Soon:\n\nJoin the Melon Token before its official launch & benefit even more. The DxSale will launch on Friday. Join our official Telegram account to be updated constantly about the release time. The Dev team there is continuously online and open for any requests. AirDrops will also be available soon.

    "text": "It's a terrible situation to be faced with, I should know, I have been a victim many times. I have learned the hard way and thankfully from these experiences I have the knowledge which helps me make better investment decisions and that is why I only invest in community owned projects still in their infancy; projects that have a low market cap with great potential!\n\nHere's the story of the token that I'll be talking about today. \n\nLaika Coin.\n\nOn April 27th the original LaikaCoin developer claimed that Virgin Galactic had targeted LaikaCoin for using their logos and name in association with a promotion without consultation or authorization following an article on [NASDAQ.com](https://NASDAQ.com) attributing LaikaCoin with a rise in Virgin Galactic\u2019s share price. Allegedly, Virgin Galactic threatened legal action against the [LaikaCoin.com](https://LaikaCoin.com) domain host, and the host was forced to take down the site and disclose their personal details. In a panic that they were about to face legal action, the developer sold the tokens from their personal wallet (over 5% of circulating supply) crashing the price and causing many of us to panic-sell. We would like to emphasize that this is not a rug pull and that the contract and all liquidity remain untouched. Ownership was renounced. The original developer left the project.\n\nLaikaCoin Rises! Yes, the Dev abandoned the project, but the contract was renounced which really means this project can survive without the Dev. Investors saw this opportunity and revived LaikaCoin putting together a strong and talented team which has put community at the centre of this thriving project. LaikaCoin now grows from strength to strength, day by day and is outperforming many projects which fail to survive even with their original Dev intact.\n\nHere are the milestones achieved by the community:\n\n1. The team leads have doxxed for transperancy and trust!\n\n2. CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko track LaikaCoin\n\n3. Website redesigned, LaikaCoin rebranded and transformed into a community-driven project.\n\n4. LAIKASWAP, a customized DEX version of PCS launched connecting directly into the v1 liquidity pool.\n\n5. The community is partnering with $Crypt for production and sales of Laika NFTs. \n\n6. Almost daily AMA'S being held hosted either by the Laika community or the many great crypto community groups out there!\n\n7. Over 40,000 holder and growing! \n\n8. Club 1957 launched, the community's very own social network platform integrated on the Laika Community website.\n\n9. Collective community decision to list on hotbit raising the $20k required. Amazing community spirit! \n\n10. Laika is now 7x since the community took over and they have big plans! The chart tells the only story you need to know..... Laika Rises!\n\nWe accomplished all these without a developer. We accomplished all these without paying thousands of dollars in marketing. We accomplished all these because we got each other.\n\nYou are never late. With a market cap of around $2.4 million as of this writing, there's definitely a lot of room for you before we all take off to the moon. \n\nCome join us and be part of our family!\n\nContract: 0x270877fbdadd2e28c7eaf08e528691b95684207e\n\nWebsite: [https://laikacommunity.com](https://laikacommunity.com)\n\nTG: [https://t.me/LaikaCommunity](https://t.me/LaikaCommunity)",

This is a big question nowadays as many rug pulls have been happening, well we got you guys covered. We will be burning the liquidity and renouncing the contract prior to launch and announcing it all at the same time so we will have a fair launch that no one is scared of entering.\r\n\n\r\n\nAnyways check out the website:\r\n\nContract: 0x9851accb34Dedb05802A90E6311397Ed41b98d55\r\n\nBURN AND RENOUNCE PROOF ON THE TELEGRAM!\r\n\n\r\n\n[ChocoCoin.pro](https://ChocoCoin.pro)\r\n\n\r\n\nJoin the Telegram too!\r\n\n\r\n\n[https://t.me/chococoinbsc](https://t.me/chococoinbsc)",

We don\u2019t perceive ticket forging or resale to an unintended recipient as an issue. The threats associated with the wrong people accessing your event are, unfortunately, known. From sexual harassment to active shooter occurrences, tracing tickets could give potential intelligence to avoid unwanted individuals to gain access.\n\n\ud83d\udd3aThis makes blockchain ticketing very appealing for events that have security in mind and want to be able to have stricter control over who gains access to the event.\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/DigityMoon](https://t.me/DigityMoon)\n\n\ud83d\udcc8Tokenomics \ud83d\udcc8\n\nTotal Supply: 800,000,000\n\nMax Hold: 1%\n\nTax: 10\n\n\ud83d\udcb0Anti Dumping \ud83d\udcb0\n\n20% for the first 1st Hour\n\n10% normal taxation (LP and holders)\n\n\ud83d\ude94 Roadmap \ud83d\ude94\n\nPhase 1: Soft Launch\n\n\u2022Fair Launch of Token (No Presale)\n\n\u2022Whitepaper\n\n\u2022Website Launch\n\n\u2022Pancakeswap listing\n\n\u2022Social Media Platforms\n\n\u2022Coinhunt, Coinsniper, Freshcoins applications\n\n\u2022Poocoin Ads\n\n\u2022Coingecko listing\n\n\u2022Community AMA\n\n\u2022Teaser of DigityMoon app (BETA)\n\nPhase 2\n\n\u2022Official Launch of Upgraded Website (V2)\n\n\u2022Launch of DigityMoon Merch / Fundraising NFT's\n\n\u2022DigityMoon BETA release\n\n\u2022Devs and team will doxx\n\n\u2022CMC listing\n\n\u2022Social Media Campaigns\n\n\u2022AMA with a vast audience group\n\nPhase 3:\n\n\u2022Whitebit listing\n\n\u2022Hotbit listing\n\n\u2022Certik Audit\n\n\u2022Marketing campaign commences\n\n\u2022Applications to larger CEX's (TBA)\n\nPhase 4:\n\n\u2022DigityMoon1.0 Official public release\n\n\u2022Much more, to be confirmed.\n\nWhitepaper can be found on the website.\n\n\u2705Links:\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/DigityMoon](https://t.me/DigityMoon)",

    "text": "# Want 10 Billion Free More Tokens? You can have them.\n\nIs there a catch? Not really.\n\n**They're giving away 10 billion free More tokens ($MORE) to every single person**, and all you've gotta do is spread the word a little.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSounds too simple? It is. It's ridiculously simple, and it takes you 20 seconds.\n\nYou send them your wallet address, and then you get your free More tokens.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut what are these More tokens?\n\nJust another memecoin. Like - that's it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me explain real quick --\n\nWhat's the difference between a memecoin that claims to have some revolutionary algorithmic garbage, and a memecoin that does nothing?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll give you a few seconds to think...\n\nAnd a few more...\n\n...\n\nWell, you guessed it - the difference is - nothing. Nothing at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore tokens have the same tokenomics as all the other coins (2% to holders, 2% to liquidity) - they're deflationary cryptocurrency, and they have zero use-case...\n\n**Why no use case? Because use-cases are overrated.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, please good sir, tell me, before people used gold/silver/diamonds/dogecoin, was there a use-case for them?\n\nNo.\n\nBut once people used them, there was the use-case - BECAUSE people had them, people... used them.\n\nMoney is an imaginary construct - banks print more all the time.\n\nThe advantage of More Tokens is that they can't print more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce they renounce ownership and burn the liquidity, it'll become decentralized.\n\n**A continually decreasing supply - THIS RIGHT HERE is the key**, and this is what More tokens gives you.\n\nNo fluff. No BS. You can integrate it into anything you'd like down the line.\n\nThe use-case comes from people USING the tokens in the first place.\n\nSo, instead of trying to create some fancy innovative marketplace blah de blah, More tokens is simply this:\n\n**Having More tokens... gives you more tokens** (since 2% is rewarded to holders).\n\nThe end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd since people need to actually USE the tokens before it becomes mainstream, they're giving everyone 10 BILLION More tokens for completely free.\n\nEveryone. Yes, you, the person reading this - can get 10 BILLION FREE More tokens right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust go to their Telegram group and follow their instructions:\n\n**Telegram:** [t.me/themoretoken](https://t.me/themoretoken)\n\n**Website:** [themoretoken.com](https://themoretoken.com/)\n\n**Twitter:** [twitter.com/themoretoken](https://twitter.com/themoretoken)\n\n**Yes, 10 billion More tokens for completely free.** I can only imagine what they'll be worth once they actually launch - 10x? 100x? 1000x?...

    "text": "Welcome to Weedshare! \ud83c\udf3f\n\nWeedShare just launched 5 days ago and already got some major Weed influencers on board. We're happy to announce that Rapper and Weed enthusiast Mason Ray Parker has agreed to promote WeedShare on his Instagram. We'd like to extend a warm welcome to him and his 1.7M followers.\n\nThis is a big step for the entire community, but the WeedShare-train isn't stopping anytime soon. We'll announce more partnerships in the coming days and weeks, so stay tuned!\n\nWe've also passed over 4000 holders and have now successfully applied for a listing at CoinGecko.\n\nBut there's one more thing:\n\nWe're doing a Live AMA in the coming days. WeedShare is all about transparency. We want to be open with our community about every step we take. Please submit your questions on our subreddit and we'll make you to ask the team your questions during the live broadcast.\n\nWhat's WeedShare?\n\nWeedShare is a deflationary token on launched by an international team (Canada, Germany, Italy) on May 28th.\n\nThe goal is to create an exchange platform that provides a secure and discrete form of exchange for the Cannabis industry. WeedShare is looking to partner with established players in the industry (both production and retail) to introduce our protocol as medium of exchange.\n\nAt the same time, WeedShare plans to help organizations continue the fight for legalization efforts of cannabis around the world. This includes the use of cannabis for both medical and recreational uses.\n\nWhy is WeedShare different: MultiSig Enforced Wallets\n\nAs an added security feature for the community of WeedShare, the Gnosis Safe MultiSig platform was implemented. This smart contract wallet requires a minimum number of people to approve every transaction before it can occur.\n\nThis means that a multi-signature sign-off from the whole WeedShare team is required for any transaction. This includes our personal tokens but also a specifically created marketing wallet.\n\nAs part of the WeedShare community, you benefit from this, because it means that none of the core team will be able to sell their tokens and leave you with the bags. This is a long term project for us - this is why we've protected ourselves from rogue team-members.\n\nInfo\n\n\ud83d\udcc4Litepaper on weedshare.org\n\n\ud83d\udd10Team wallets locked (on-chain guarantee!)\n\nDevs Doxxed\n\nTokenomics\n\nTotal supply: 420,000,000,000,000 (of course it is)\n\n\ud83d\udcb010% Tax\n\n5% redistributed to every holder & burned\n\n5% added to liquidity\n\n\ud83d\udd12 Liquidity Burned\n\nPancakeswap V2\n\nMilestones:\n\n(DONE) Twitter partnerships by \\\\@cryptopolica (60k followers)\n\n(DONE) Partnership with Aerodrop\n\n(DONE) Listing on CoinSniper\n\n(DONE) No1 Trending on GemSpree\n\n(DONE) CoinGecko listing applied\n\n(Ongoing) Partnership with weed influencer and musician Mason Ray Parker\n\n(Today) Coinhunt listing\n\n(Soon) More partnerships with people in the weed community\n\n(Soon) Live AMA\n\nLong Term Roadmap\n\nQ2 2021\n\n(Ongoing) Promotion and growth of a strong community\n\n(Ongoing) Influencer Campaigns\n\nQ3 2021\n\n(Ongoing) Listings on Gecko and CMC\n\nTalks with business customers like coffee shops about adopting WeedShare\n\nLet's Share\n\n\u2705 Contract: 0xf4571308b708a1d4632d8e50b4460da1ef6494e5\n\nTG: t.me/WeedshareOfficial\n\nWebsite: weedshare.org\n\nSubreddit: weedshare (planned AMA with the mod team later this week)",

    "text": "Came across this project by coincidence while hunting for community driven charity token, where I saw #Zombieland listings advertised everywhere. \nTo kill my curiosity, I looked them up and this is what I've learned so far. I wanted to share it with you guys cos I have a decent feeling about their sincerity (although they're not doxxed wanted to remind anonymous as donator). Hey, they started donation with W.H.O Covid-19 fund and transparently provide all the transaction proof.\n\nKey Takeaway:\n\u2705 The token donates directly to official fund such as W.H.O COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund. They'll pre-inform all the holders whenever they want to take out fund from Charity wallet by stages via announcement. Being transparent on the donated has been made so far.\n\n\u2705 Get community involved and listened to their voice in the deciding next charity organization/fund to be donated thru members voting. Thus, no funny rug-pulled project for fast gain.\n\n\u2705 Shared the awareness of current pandemic situation and lead the community for assisting world organization in combating COVID-19.\n\n\u2705 Decent and friendly developer & moderator team as well as superbly strong support from the community. Developer and moderator trying their very best to address any members concern regardless they've invested or sideliner. Everyone stand together and felt like in a family.\n\n\u2705 Telegram support were managed in great manners with various link for you to do a research. Website, Twitter, Whitepaper, Audit, Contracts Renounced, Chart or even stickers uniquely made (and funny).\n\n\u2705 The website is unique and doesn't have a copy and paste from others. Same with their whitepaper; it looks legit. Audited by Techrate.\n\n\u2705 Low developer wallet (only at 2%) and Charity wallet (5%). Tax goes back to holders and liqudity, which mean when you hold longer you'll get more benefit. Win-win for holder.\n\n\u2705 They have intention to build a platform to do rug check at new project where they called it \"SMART Rug-Check Platform\" once they get enough fund. They're still looking for decent and passionate partner to work on this project.\n\n\u2705 Liquidity locked. They provide the link in the telegram group.\n\n\u2705 Daily Progress Update provided and pinned.\n\nThis isn't financial advice & DYOR but I believe they can grow further given that how passionate the team is. Their coordination and progress is top notch, this is one of efficient and successful team key value. Never forget their sincerity and tranparency.\n\nUseful Links as below;\nToken name: Zombieland ($ZLD)\n\nWebsite: https://zombieland.finance/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/zombieland_finance (@zombieland_finance)\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ZLD_Finance\n\nContract: 0x12B756e88faEd82923B557041128D2d024E75f0B",

We don\u2019t perceive ticket forging or resale to an unintended recipient as an issue. The threats associated with the wrong people accessing your event are, unfortunately, known. From sexual harassment to active shooter occurrences, tracing tickets could give potential intelligence to avoid unwanted individuals to gain access.\n\n\ud83d\udd3aThis makes blockchain ticketing very appealing for events that have security in mind and want to be able to have stricter control over who gains access to the event.\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/DigityMoon](https://t.me/DigityMoon)\n\n\ud83d\udcc8Tokenomics \ud83d\udcc8\n\nTotal Supply: 800,000,000\n\nMax Hold: 1%\n\nTax: 10\n\n\ud83d\udcb0Anti Dumping \ud83d\udcb0\n\n20% for the first 1st Hour\n\n10% normal taxation (LP and holders)\n\n\ud83d\ude94 Roadmap \ud83d\ude94\n\nPhase 1: Soft Launch\n\n\u2022Fair Launch of Token (No Presale)\n\n\u2022Whitepaper\n\n\u2022Website Launch\n\n\u2022Pancakeswap listing\n\n\u2022Social Media Platforms\n\n\u2022Coinhunt, Coinsniper, Freshcoins applications\n\n\u2022Poocoin Ads\n\n\u2022Coingecko listing\n\n\u2022Community AMA\n\n\u2022Teaser of DigityMoon app (BETA)\n\nPhase 2\n\n\u2022Official Launch of Upgraded Website (V2)\n\n\u2022Launch of DigityMoon Merch / Fundraising NFT's\n\n\u2022DigityMoon BETA release\n\n\u2022Devs and team will doxx\n\n\u2022CMC listing\n\n\u2022Social Media Campaigns\n\n\u2022AMA with a vast audience group\n\nPhase 3:\n\n\u2022Whitebit listing\n\n\u2022Hotbit listing\n\n\u2022Certik Audit\n\n\u2022Marketing campaign commences\n\n\u2022Applications to larger CEX's (TBA)\n\nPhase 4:\n\n\u2022DigityMoon1.0 Official public release\n\n\u2022Much more, to be confirmed.\n\nWhitepaper can be found on the website.\n\n\u2705Links:\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/DigityMoon](https://t.me/DigityMoon)",

    "text": "&#x200B;\n\n**Links:**\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/Kawi\\_world](https://t.me/Kawi_world) \ud83d\udc8c\n\nWebsite: [https://Kawi.world](https://kawi.world/) \ud83c\udf10\n\nMedium: [https://kawi-world.medium.com](https://kawi-world.medium.com/)\ud83d\udca8\n\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/KawiWorld](https://twitter.com/KawiWorld) **\ud83d\udc26**\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHi guys,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm back with an update on $Kawi. I will give a short summary if you guys forgot what $Kawi is;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKAWI is a new game on the Binance Smart Chain with its own virtual currency; $KAWI. Inhabitants or \u2018Kawians\u2019 are able to buy unique assets in the form of **Non Fungible Tokens (NFT\u2019s)** which will generate staking rewards in the form of the $KAWI currency, which fuels the \u2018Kawiconomy\u2019.\n\nThe NFT\u2019s can exist in many forms, such as a large mansion down the lake, a skyscraper in a jetset city but also an electric sports car. As an inhabitant of KAWI, you can decide what kind of NFT we release in time. The world of KAWI will consist of 7 different continents which will have their own unique characteristics.\n\nWith Kawi you can buy/sell/trade/stake your assets (NFTS) and decide how you want to earn your profits. They have also stated on their website that **lootboxes** will be introduced eventually which will contain rare nft's that you can use in the world of kawi. The $kawi tokens can also be used for **governance** so kawians can vote what changes will be made in the game and what should be added into the game. I think this is really cool because you actually have the chance to see the building you want in-game. **For a full overview check out their website and read the whitepaper.** Small preview of the website:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Buy, Sell and Win**\n\nThe assets within $KAWI can be traded on KAWI\u2019s marketplace. The KAWI marketplace is an internal marketplace where users can sell their assets to others. The number of assets per continent is fixed, which automatically means that the total number of assets in the $Kawi world is fixed. The assets continue to generate value within the game so every player will want to get their hands on the high profit assets. This mechanism will drive our economy, players can choose to trade these assets at their own price on the exchange.\n\nIt is also possible to WIN Assets. In future releases of KAWI, the LOOTBOX will be introduced, this BOX will become available at a random period. This Box will contain special prices for our players to WIN. If you missed out on that special asset. Luck might strike you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Further usp's that made me invested in this project \ud83d\udd25:**\n\n* Doxxed team with linked-in\n* An actual project with a unique concept that is on the bsc (unlike all the scams that is on there..)\n* The website looks amazing\n* They are being audited by RD Auditors (the group that did the audits for; bscstarter / verum protocol / Wallstreetbets and more check out their portfolio)\n* Liquidity will be locked\n* The team is very responsive on telegram\n* Partnership with SAFU and will be the premiere IDO on their platform\n* The tokenomics which can be found [HERE](https://kawi-world.medium.com/kawi-tokenomics-86d989552f29)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Updates**: They have partnered with $SAFU and they will be the first IDO on their launchpad!\n\nThere are 2 pools where you can participate in the sale;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The public sale is divided into 2 pools:**\n\n**Safu pool (Guaranteed allocation)**\n\n**Kawi pool (Whitelist lottery)**\n\n**For the Kawi pool you need to fill the whitelist form**\n\n**For the Safu pool there is tiering mechanism. Hold a minimum amount of safu to get allocation:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSafu Pool: Standard\n\nHold 66.666.666 SAFU\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSafu Pool: Premium\n\nHold 333.333.333 SAFU\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSafu Pool: SAFU (gold tier)\n\nHold 666.666.666 SAFU\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKAWI Pool (public) (Community whitelist form)\n\nHold 0 SAFU\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My advice is to sign the form and hold some $Safu to get more chances.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\ud83d\udd25 Thats all for now. Happy investing guys and goodluck! \ud83d\udd25**",

The token is now listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. In addition, you can also now track your SkyBorn value through your TrustWallet, no custom token entry needed! SkyBorn's social outreach is also growing and it is undoubtable that this is going far given the community behind it, many of whom built SafeMoon into what it has become! The devs and the community have been working overtime to scale up this project big time. It began as simply an idea and has grown into a dedicated community of hard working individuals looking to make a mark in the crypto-space by creating a community by the holders for the holders.\n\nSkyBorn is a decentralized token that runs on the Binance Smart Chain. SkyBorn offers two main utilities including burn and redistribution as incentives for its holders, each at 4% per transaction. SkyBorn is designed for the community, by the community, to engage and have fun with one another.\n\nTokenomics: Total Supply: 1 Trillion Presale price (min 0.1, max 1): 1 bnb = 13.5 Billion.

It is a great opportunity getting into legitimate projects early at a low Marketcap. 10x or 100x isn\u2019t even a impossible dream, it really is possible.\n\n\n\nAnyways here I present to you Chococoin - our aim is to get our name popping in the crypto world, we want attention - yes we are attention seekers. We want publicity, we want to go big.\n\nRecently there has been a upsurge in tons of new tokens being started and projects being abandoned when their not doing well - well over here it is not what you\u2019ll see, we are 3 ordinary developers who do this as a hobby - not a financial gain, so we will not be abandoning no projects, we will be growing this token day by day, week by week, month by month!\n\nWe have great marketing plans for this coin as we\u2019ve seen many coins succeed and fail in this market - so we\u2019ve come up with the best way to almost guarantee success.\n\nWhat makes us SAFE? This is a big question nowadays as many rug pulls have been happening, well we got you guys covered. We will be burning the liquidity and renouncing the contract prior to launch and announcing it all at the same time so we will have a fair launch that no one is scared of entering.\n\nAnyways check out the website:\nChocoCoin.pro \n\nContract: 0x9851accb34Dedb05802A90E6311397Ed41b98d55\n\nBurned Liquidity: \nhttps://bscscan.com/tx/0xd6ac1cb9b6846cde08c2a47a380582bf22a591aa466d7e5268cbb4e9da006d25\n\nRenounced Ownership: \nhttps://bscscan.com/tx/0x4be7f3098965c15c02c85a6812aacf10e302fffe5d7fc08889af7d19ce032b6e\n\n\n\n[ChocoCoin.pro](https://ChocoCoin.pro)\n\n\n\nJoin the Telegram too!\n\n\n\n[https://t.me/chococoinbsc](https://t.me/chococoinbsc)",

This crypto feels a lot like that. It encourages holding and discourages the typical pump and dump.\n\nAre you tired of always holding the bag? Tired of a few select whales taking all the profits? Tired of not having your hard HODL work show consistent results? Well, you should be happy you read this post as you just got an early invite to what could possibly be the craziest crypto experiment of the year. 5050 token just launched a couple days ago and its tokenomics are absolutely crazy! With a 50% tax (40% redistribution for holders, 10% for liquidity), 5050 token was made for holders and holders only.\n\nThis token is meant to be fun. The telegram will not be banning fudders. We believe it will be fun to watch the community pick sides and encouraging one another to sell first.

We\u2019re more than happy to answer any questions you might have. However, this token is going to be as simple as it gets. With the high transaction fee, holders will be rewarded.

Check out their whitepaper and look at a preview of their tool.\n\nLet's get into some updates!\n\n**David Gokhshtein \u2013 400k crypto members in his group/twitter:**\n\nDan (the COO of Hoodrat) became a speaker on his panel advising on the crypto space. Dan hasn\u2019t \u2018plugged\u2019 the Hoodrat token to the group yet in order to achieve a reputation within the group first but will do in the future.\n\n**Rebranding Hoodrat logo:**\n\nCriticism was received about the name \u2018Hoodrat.\u2019 People may have a hard time surpassing the name due to cultural differences. As of now, the logo of the rat will be changed. Additionally, the idea of migrating to a new blockchain in the future was discussed e.g. ADA, ETH etc. During this potential stage, the name of Hoodrat may be changed. The decisions surrounding this will most likely be voted on by the community.\n\n**2 videos being produced:**\n\n* New \u2018How to buy\u2019 video \u2013 Precise, easy, in-depth.\n* 3D Animated Advertisement for Hoodrat \u2013 designed by an animator that has worked on Pixar projects and other big projects such as the Lego Movie and Ratatouille.\n\n**Ballerfantasy Project Rugpull:**\n\nThe Ballerfantasy project launched a few days ago and Dan invested in it because he was a fan of the content and was their largest investor and wanted it to be successful. However, they ended up rugging and Dan introduced the remaining holders to Hoodrat which caused an increase in telegram members and Hoodrat holders.\n\nThis story gives us an example of how important this project actually is and an example of how we, as a community can bring people in and let them know about our project.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\nMarketing wallet has not been touched yet. We believe that the market cap of Hoodrat should be more substantial before this is used. Marketing is currently being paid for by the developers own money. Another TikTok just dropped. The team said there are some big ones to come next.\n\n\\------------------------------\n\n$HOODRAT is BSC's next-level BEP-20 token that aims to redistribute the wealth among holders tired of saving whales, the environment and homeless dogs while being rugged, scammed and robbed. The only person that deserves to be saved is you.\n\nNot a memecoin, utility token building an anti-rug pull screen tool based on Machine Learning for the whole crypto community to use.\n\nRug pulls don\u2019t only affect investors, they affect the entire crypto community. This is why we exist and what our vision is, to identify rug pulls BEFORE they happen and give investors peace of mind.\n\n* **\u2714\ufe0f CoinGecko Listing**\n* **\u2714\ufe0f Stocktwits Listing**\n* **\u2714\ufe0f Delta Listing**\n* **\u2714\ufe0fDoxxed Team**\n* **\u2714\ufe0fCelebrity Endorsed**\n\n\u2705\ud83e\uddc0\ud83d\udc00BUY HERE\ud83d\udc00\ud83e\uddc0\u2705\n\nhttps://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xb54a58cdc7d3fefd93ea4454e0c1a23da8bedc6f\n\n\ud83e\uddc0 CHART WATCHERS HERE \ud83e\uddc0\n\npoocoin.app/tokens/0xb54a58cdc7d3fefd93ea4454e0c1a23da8bedc6f  \n\n\n* \ud83e\uddc0 Contract: 0xb54a58cdc7d3fefd93ea4454e0c1a23da8bedc6f\n* \ud83e\uddc0 1,000,000,000 Total Supply\n* \ud83e\uddc0 50% of supply burnt after adding to Pancakeswap\n* \ud83e\uddc0 5% Of Every Transaction is automatically burnt\n* \ud83e\uddc0 5% Of Every Transaction Redistributed To Holders\n* \ud83e\uddc0Locked Liquidity\n\n**THE DOXED TEAM:**\n\nMade up of talented developers, strategists and marketers who all worked for Fortune 500 companies with over 20 years experience in the technical consulting sector, 5 years in the high-tech industry and 10 years in the financial sector.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nWebsite: [https://hoodrat.finance](https://hoodrat.finance/)\n\nTG: [https://t.me/HoodratOfficial](https://t.me/HoodratOfficial)\n\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/FinanceHoodrat](https://twitter.com/FinanceHoodrat)\n\nTwitch AMAs: [twitch.tv/hoodrattoken](https://twitch.tv/hoodrattoken)",

    "text": "The Dexio team are currently working hard on our new app wallet, and we have a beta release to test. Join our telegram community to be part of our beta test program for our iOS wallet app (Android to follow shortly). \n\nDexi is a newly released project that focuses on certain key targets in the world of cryptocurrency. Around 100 million people in the entire world are using cryptocurrency. A lot of people still do not know how to get into cryptocurrency and what cryptocurrency even is. We aim to solve this issue by introducing AR technology into the world of crypto. By combining AR with cryptocurrency, it unlocks a pathway where potential new investors have a fun and interactive way to collect crypto whilst also learning how to invest it wisely. This will not only increase the value of the crypto market as a whole but also protect new users from the affect of bear markets, pump and dumps, whales, and so forth.\n\nSo, what is Dexioprotocol? It is a new cryptocurrency launched on the Binance smart chain with a sticker symbol Dexi. It aims to implement a new new way of engagement to the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency using an Augmented reality application and crypto bounties place around the world. These token bounties will be available around the globe, think Pok\u00e9mon go but catching crypto rather than Pok\u00e9mon. The new app will also have your own private wallet (released this week), transaction tracking and of course an augmented reality camera allowing you to snap up those crypto bounties!\n\nEvents will be hosted through augmented reality. Our augmented reality bounties will offer great rewards when found. Our reason behind this is to offer a passive way to generate income by holding tokens, but also offer a way to make earning tokens more rewarding. Our bounties will take place around the globe and the app will notify the user when a bounty is near. All you need is your mobile phone. Do note that our puzzles will take effort to solve. But with great effort comes great reward!\n\nOur project is developing a mobile application that is backed by our token. We\u2019ll introduce people to AR(augmented reality bounties). People across the globe will be able to hunt token bounties that will get hosted as events. This will make earning cryptocurrency fun and rewarding. Our white paper and website describe this feature. I hope you take the time to read through it.\n\nThe team are also researching the cardano Alonso network, once released our development team will start developing on their network and investigate its many available possibilities.\n\nFor each dexi trade, three percent of it gets burnt, this increases its value in the long run. Three percent gets added to the liquidity pool and three percent gets rewarded to the holders of the token.\n\nThis system rewards the holders of the token and is a passive way of generating tokens. We are well established an have a great community on our discord and telegram sites. Join us today using the links below, you won\u2019t want to miss out on the great opportunity!\n\nDEXI is also a deflationary cryptocurrency:  \n\ud83d\udd25 3% of tokens are burned during each transaction  \n\ud83d\udc8e 3% of tokens are redistributed  \n\ud83d\ude80 500,000,000,000 supply, of which 25% was burned already as voted by our telegram community.  \n\ud83d\udc8e Liquidity has been locked  \n\ud83d\udc8e Less than 1000 holders at the moment  \n\ud83d\udd25 Entire Dexi team is already doxxed (see website for details)\n\nCMC listing: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dexioprotocol](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dexioprotocol) favourite and vote please  \nJoin the community on telegram for more information: [https://t.me/Dexiochat](https://t.me/Dexiochat)  \nLink of the website and whitepaper: [https://dexioprotocol.com/](https://dexioprotocol.com/)  \nJoin our Discord for free giveaways [https://discord.gg/ugtHNNbjdW](https://discord.gg/ugtHNNbjdW)  \nPancake swap - smart contract: 0x29b1E39A529d3B3cacEA55989594F71813e998Bb  \nVideo of the scanning feature of DEXI app being developed: [https://kapwi.ng/c/K5uGspQ8](https://kapwi.ng/c/K5uGspQ8)  \nYouTube channel with intro to DEXIOPROTOCOL [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90VxUQO4-CE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90VxUQO4-CE)",

Everyone that gets this coin in its early stages will be rewarded and will have the chance to get whitelisted for one of the *biggest projects ever seen* (it will be a surprise, but once it\u2019s public you will be as excited and motivated as we are)\n\n*To consider:*\n\u2022 The devs will be doxxed after launch day \u2014 we have learned that getting doxxed is a powerful tool to make some huge noise.\n\u2022 If BTC is too volatile on launch day, we will postpone it. In that case, BNB would go down in prices and no new proyect would last a day. Instead, if we catch BTC on an up-trend, *we will moon regardless* due to BNB going up in price.\n \n\u2026 Yes, the liquidity will be locked and ownership renounced when we launch.\n\n_Let\u2019s see if you got balls of steel_ \ud83d\ude0e \u2013 Dev.\n\n*Telegram:* https://t.me/joinchat/TBt6XzPfk-U1NzI5\n\n*Website:* https://ballsofsteel.site/\n\n*TikTok:* https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMevEQdGD/\n\n*Instagram:* https://instagram.com/bos_token?utm_medium=copy_link\n\n*Twitter:* https://twitter.com/ballstoken?s=21",

Don\u2019t miss out! \n\nThe first eligibility window starts NOW! If you buy and hold AXC before 5:00 PM PDT/8:00 PM EDT, you\u2019ll be eligible to receive rewards on June 12th! Just be sure to hold and not sell during the window!\n\nDetails on rewards:\n\nWe are proud to announce our distribution-schedule for AXC Holders and how the qualification works! \n\nEvery week, the countdown starts Saturday at 00:00 UTC (Friday 17:00 PDT/20:00 EDT) and ends the following Saturday at 00:00 UTC (Friday 17:00 PDT/20:00 EDT). \n\nIf you did not buy in during this timeframe, you will not be qualified for the distribution the following Friday.\n\nAlso you need to hold the tokens straight for at least 7 days, you won\u2018t be distributed if you sell in that time and buy again! This process won\u2018t be processed manually, it will be done automatically.\n\nThanks and have a wonderful hold!\u201d\n\nJoin the Telegram channel to learn more or ask any questions!\n\n\ud83d\udcdd PROGRESS REPORT \ud83d\udcdd\n\n\u2705 Successful Presale, sold 100%\n\n\u2705 Day 1: steady Market Cap of $50,000+ and 50 holders\n\n\u2705 Day 2: MC jumped to $75,000 and just shy of 100 \n\n\u2705 Day 3: Current: $175,000 MC and 160 holders. \n\n\u2705 Day 4: Rewards process outlined, Correction dip has occurred, EXCELLENT time to buy and hold! Market Cap under $125k \n\n\ud83d\ude80 WHY ALPHAEX? \ud83d\ude80\n\nThis token has set itself apart from the rest by starting out from the beginning with the goal of getting listed on major coin exchanges. With this in mind, AXC isn\u2019t your typical tokenomics where reflections are disbursed automatically to holders (this makes getting listed on Coinbase or Binance near impossible). \n\nInstead, AXC collects transaction fees and holds them in a rewards wallet, which will be used to distribute rewards to holders on a weekly cadence - think air drop. The first disbursement has yet to occur and there\u2019s still time to get in on the rewards!!\ud83d\udc8e\n\nOnce the plans for listing take shape, this coin will take off. It\u2019s super low current market cap still makes it easy to get in and be a part of something great from the beginning. \n\nThe team is also working hard on the next steps of the project, which includes further marketing and things such as a flex wallet and Project Excelsior - more info on this can be found on the website or in the Whitepaper. Check it out!\n\nFlex wallet is a very interesting concept too, and while there isn\u2019t much that can be said at the moment, please note that this will play a big part in future developments at AlphaEX. Stay tuned!\n\nThese guys are very open to receive suggestions and feedback to improve and get this as far as it can. \n\nBe part of it!

The market cap is approx $38m right now and I personally feel this is very very cheap for what this project is and what's coming.\n\nPros:\n\n1. The team have already signed some big names in the adult world: Briana Banderas, Annabelle Rogers, Lissa Aires, Megan Hughes and more to come with announcements being posted on the official TG most evenings.\n2. The app mockups look very professional and I think it will explode when launched.\n3. CMC is listed, and CoinGecko should be coming imminently. There's about 10k members on the official TG. 4)There's also a very good promo on YouTube but I won't include the link here because CMS doesn't like too many.\n\nCons: I appreciate there's a few tokens of this nature out there, I was an early investor in another one, but I honestly feel that $pornrocket has the action to back up the mouth. I just sold my bag on that other Rocket and put it into this\n\nAnyway this is not financial advice , do your own research and then check it out. I believe this is a serious moonshot, and am going to go up my bags after I drop this post.\n\nMarketing on this token is nuts.

    "text": "This is not just another meme coin. This is the perfect hedge. But it does not only act as a hedging instrument against market downturns, it also especially shines in bull markets. We want to introduce you to our own patentable invention, a totally new concept in finance, something that we call the \"absolute Beta approach\"\n\nWe interpret the absolute Beta approach in a way that the price of the token positively correlates with the market in bull markets, however, at the same time negatively correlates with the market in bear markets. To simplify; In Bull markets you profit, in bear markets you have a high profit potential as well.\n\nThe tokenomics, which are highly deflationary, reward people for long-term holding. What does that imply for you? You do not need to worry about the balancing of long/short positions (e.g. call / put options), you have the advantages of both features combined in one single instrument. Due to the taxation mechanism, high volume is your portfolio\u2019s new best friend.\n\nFAIR LAUNCH (NO PRESALE!)

    "text": "HIDDEN GEM TO DETHRONE ROOBET?!?!\nWhat's up guys\nSo I've been holding this coin called Mello Token for quite some time and honestly they have blown me away. From partnerships to app development and casino updates, they have pumped out more content then any shitcoin I've ever had.\n\nI'm the kind of guy to hold on to a BSc token for a 2x-10x and get rid of it fast af. However, Mello token is a hidden gem and I'm holding for the long haul! I personally think this is gonna be bigger then roobet\n\nWhat is Mello?\n\nMello Token is a redistributive cryptocurrency rooted in the Mello Virtual Reality Casino concept, designed to provide automatic flowing rewards for holders and players alike. A 3% redistribution fee is placed on all transfers, purchases, and sales of Mello (outside of exchanges) which is rewarded to all holders. Put simply, all holders of Mello earn rewards on a constant basis which will be eligible for play inside the Mello casino.\n\nWhy Mello?\nThe Mello team has been equal parts meticulous and aggressive in the development process of their project thus far. The team has already shown their faces and are obviously committed... they have been checking off items from their roadmap one by one.\n\nEntering the enormous casino market with high transaction volume, the 3% redistribution has the potential to prove wildly beneficial for holders of Mello. Launched a month ago and with a market cap of roughly $12 million, Mello Token has tons of room to grow.\n\nThe first iteration Mello web Casino will launch by the end of Q3 / beginning of Q4, after which the team will be focusing their efforts on Virtual Reality development and partnerships. Mello is currently in the process of forming further partnerships which will help facilitate the development of other aspects of the Mello vision.\n\nThe designers have been hard at work creating conceptual assets, some of which were presented during our AMA in our VR Concept walkthrough.\n\nIn case you missed the walkthrough, check it out on their AMA recording. Timestamps for VR concept walkthrough 26:46-29:44 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmLk9PnwCSw&t=280s\n\nIn this walkthrough they show tons of stuff!\n\nSlot Machines, Card Tables, Bar area, Sport Betting Area, and more!\n\n\nWebsite: https://www.mellotoken.com BSCscan:https://bscscan.com/token/0x651bfbb26455294408aabc61a7adf427bf149898\n\nCMC: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mello-token/\n\nCoingecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/mello-token Coinbase: https://www.coinbase.com/price/mello-token",

    "text": "If you want to just jump to the bottom and go ahead and buy, I would suggest that. When it comes to public listings like this, the early birds get the worm, so just recognize the huge names behind this and know that this is not a debate, this is a race.\n\n**Justin Sun, Founder of TRON and CEO of fucking BitTorrent** (he straight up bought it). You know, the guy who has enough money that he bid slightly less than the $69M needed to get the Beeple NFT. Who scheduled a $4.5M lunch with Warren Buffett **only to cancel on the geriatric fuck.**\n\nThis token is **listing at 120k market cap.** Take a second and let that sink in.\n\nA guy is running this project, with the ability to send it to 100x with just the pocket change in his sofa, and the public knows it. Elon eat your heart out.\n\nI feel extremely comfortable saying this is a project that\u2019s going to **1000x.** $120M is easy peasy in this market considering so many token without utility and anonymous broke teams get farther than that.\n\nAs a fair IDO platform for projects launching on the increasingly popular TRON blockchain, this could end up **being the next PolkaStarter, $120M itself currently,** having previously hit a high over $500M. And this is all near-term sort of projections, the long-term with this kind of support is monstrous.\n\nPartnering themselves with BSCPad is a massive win too as they won\u2019t simply be flying blind into the abyss. **Being the largest BSC-based IDO platform**, BSCPad has an obvious plethora of experience to build upon. \n\nIf you\u2019ve learned anything from watching this token and that token flounder about these past several months on BSC, you know exactly how much a steady hand and experience can make a difference.\n\nThe equitable approach BSCPad has developed for users on this platform will be an instant draw as TRON experiences the same sort of boom that has **sent BNB from a $30 shitcoin to the 3rd largest cryptocurrency** in the world in less than half a year.\n\nEven better, TRON isn\u2019t run by a clown who tweets shit like \u201cBuy the Dip.\u201d\n\nAnd with BSCPad\u2019s western focus, and Justin Sun\u2019s eastern influences, you can see where this may face less barriers than the aforementioned fucking nutcase.\n\nBut anyway, as good as I am at telling you about why this project is going to make you rich, you should stop reading. Immediately. **BSCPad pulled a 200x within hours on their own.**\n\nWith Justin Sun? Again sers, this is a race. May the itchiest trigger fingers win.\n\n\ud83c\udf10 [Website](http://tronpad.network/)\n\n\u270d\ufe0f [Medium](https://tronpad.medium.com/bscpad-and-tron-enter-a-strategic-partnership-to-launch-tronpad-759bcb82ac3b)\n\n\ud83e\udd5e [PancakeSwap](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x1Bf7AedeC439D6BFE38f8f9b20CF3dc99e3571C4)\n\n\ud83d\udd25 [Telegram](http://t.me/Tronpad)\n\n\ud83d\ude80 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tronpadofficial)",

LP automatic automatic The automated production of lockable liquidity inside the PancakeSwap LP contributes to each transaction.\n3. 5% fee auto to all current holders redistributed.\n4. Automatic agricultural activity (RFI) The hold token THREESOME gives Holder a passive benefit. This is an automated reward.\n5. 5% charge adding to and burning liquidity pool.\n6. 3 basic routines used by THREESOME. Reflection + LP purchase + Burn. In each deal, a 10 percent charge is imposed, divided between 2 methods.\n\nContract Address: 0xf5ad59380483b21f2bb3d87af80642e10c971d2e\n\nPurchase on PanCakeSwap: [https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xf5ad59380483b21f2bb3d87af80642e10c971d2e](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xf5ad59380483b21f2bb3d87af80642e10c971d2e)\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/ThreesomeOfficial](https://t.me/ThreesomeOfficial)\n\n**Coins Burns Auto**\n\nOften it matters; sometimes it does not matter. It does not matter. A continual burning can be pleasant at the beginning of any protocol, but this does not entail that the burn is finite or managed in any manner.The control of the burning by the team and the promotion of results contribute to the reward and information for the community. Terms of burning and quantities can be announced and tracked automatically.\n\n$THREESOME is committed to implementing a burn strategy that will benefit and benefit the long-term participants. The total burnt $THREESOME is also included in our website reading, which enables greater transparency to be applied at any particular moment of time when detecting current circulating supplies.\n\n**Liquidity Pool (LP) Auto**\n\nThe secret sauce of $THREESOME is automatic LP. There's a function here that works for holders as a double benefit. First, the contract draws tokens from both sellers and customers and adds them to the LP, which creates a strong price floor.Secondly the punishment functions as a resistive to arbitration process, which rewards holders for the volume of $THREESOME.\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/ThreesomeOfficial](https://t.me/ThreesomeOfficial)\n\nIt\u00a0is\u00a0\u00a0distinct from the combustion function of other reflections that simply benefit from the reduction in supply given in the near term. The price stability reflects this role with a strong price floor and a cupboard to holders, as the $THREESOME token LP rises.\n\nPurchase on PanCakeSwap: [https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xf5ad59380483b21f2bb3d87af80642e10c971d2e](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xf5ad59380483b21f2bb3d87af80642e10c971d2e)\n\nFor these reasons, we are convinced that our paradigm and protocol will dominate the outmoded tokens of reflection.\n\nContract Address: 0xf5ad59380483b21f2bb3d87af80642e10c971d2e\n\nThe aim here is to avoid the greater drops when whales later in the game decide to vend their tokens, so that the price does not fluctuate as much as if there is no automated LP mechanism. All this is an effort to relieve some of the problems with the present DeFi coins.The extra notion of LP is that it creates stability from the given LP by putting tax on the token's liquidity, increasing the total LP of the token and maintaining the token's market mechanism.",

    "text": "#MoonPump Token $PUMP\n\n\nGuys, a few days ago I found out about this project called MoonPump.\n\n\nA presale for it started on the 29th of May with a hardcap of 1000 BNB which was reached in 36 hours! That's crazy stuff!\n\n\nI personally missed the presale, but I am planning to buy on launch, which is tomorrow. There are a few reasons for which I'm bullish on this project that aims to be an actual altcoin that only takes advantage of the current memecoin trend.\n\n\nFirst off, the devs always delivered what they promised to deliver, such as a website, Certik audit, 10k telegram members before launch and there still is more to come!\n\n\nYesterday, to prove that they're serious they've launched lots and lots of giveaways, I'm talking about Twitter, Reddit, 4chan all of those things, basically welcoming the huge influx of new members and they're going to do the same thing today most likely, to keep the community engaged.\n\n\nAlso, not to forget, they're also making an IDO Platform called PumpLaunch where people have to do only one thing to receive an allocation. Just hold PUMP. That's it. You don't have to hold thousands of dollars of a token to even have a chance to receive an allocation. Just hold $PUMP and you will receive an allocation. It's as easy as that.\n\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Did you miss the memecoins went 1000x? I personally suggest you join the telegram and stay tuned for when the contract releases!Don't worry about dumping. The team already thought of it, the people who bought in the presale will receive 50% of their tokens 24 hours after launch and the rest 10 days after launch, if they don't sell anything of their presale allocation, which is pretty cool in my opinion.\n\n\nUseful links:\n\n\nCertik Audit: https://www.certik.org/projects/moonpump\n\n\n17k Members Telegram: https://t.me/MoonPumpTKN\n\n\nTelegram Announcements: https://t.me/moonpumptoken\n\n\nMost Recent AMA With The Lead Developer Sean:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/user-272968677/ama\n\n\nWebsite: https://MoonPump.tech\n\n\nTwitter: https://Twitter.com/MoonPumpToken\n\n\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/xGBJdGDdUk\n\n\nBitcoinTalk Article:\n https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5339872.new#new\n\n\nWin 3BNB : https://moonpump.tech/giveaway/",

    "text": "TL;DR \n\nNFT stock photo marketplace - [https://photocentra.com](https://photocentra.com/) \n\nLegal company using Paypal and Stripe (devs doxxed). Big project connecting the real world and NFT blockchain technology. The product is 90% ready, about 40k users registered, about 1 million photos uploaded. All tokens are locked and vested. \n\nTG channel [https://t.me/photocentracom](https://t.me/photocentracom)   \n\nPresale on 15 June [https://app.unicrypt.network/amm/uni-v2/ilo/0xE7eA5AFd478350C093D64B0dfc75A643D3195DFD](https://app.unicrypt.network/amm/uni-v2/ilo/0xE7eA5AFd478350C093D64B0dfc75A643D3195DFD)     \n    \nThe current situation in the stock photography market is far from perfect. The process to sale of  photos is over-complicated. All photo art makers have suffered the most in this situation. They have only 15-40%.  The rest is taken by the platforms. The average price of a stock photo is only $3. A photographer, recently registered on any stock marketplace, will get approximately $0.45 from a sale. This is infinitely small considering the huge price a photographer has to pay for gears and his or her hard work to create quality images.    \n\n  \n**NFT technology will change everything.**   \n\nA Non-Fungible Token is a record in the blockchain. This is a proof of your rights to the image. So, if you have been purchased a stock photo in the form of NFT - you can easily to prove your rights on it forever. This is because the information about your rights recorded in the blockchain can not be deleted at all.     \n\n\n**Can you imagine\u2026** if you can sell photos for $1.5 and get the whole amount at once without any commissions? Actually, this is 3 times more than you get now from popular stock marketplaces. Also this is almost 2 times more profitable for buyers too. A buyer pays a small commission (4.9%) which goes to buyback tokens to create a value for holders. A photographer will get the payment immediately to his wallet, bypassing all intermediaries such as payment systems.   \n\n\nBesides stock photos, you can also sell your artistic photos as NFT at any price you want.     \n  \n\n**Presale on 15 June**     \n50% liquidity locked for 6 months. All other tokens also locked for 6 months and then vested for 2 years in slow growing parts. \n\n[https://app.unicrypt.network/amm/uni-v2/ilo/0xE7eA5AFd478350C093D64B0dfc75A643D3195DFD](https://app.unicrypt.network/amm/uni-v2/ilo/0xE7eA5AFd478350C093D64B0dfc75A643D3195DFD)     \n  \n\n**Contract address:** 0xa916e0cdc69ecffb33e780b60616e207bf675aa6     \n  \n\nTo know the recent news, please join us in social networks \n\n[https://t.me/photocentracom](https://t.me/photocentracom)   \n\n[https://twitter.com/photocentracom](https://twitter.com/photocentracom)   \n\n[https://photocentracom.medium.com](https://photocentracom.medium.com/)     \n  \n\nForward this article to artists you know (Ask for feedback) \n\n**No more fees.

The Muskrat team have added in a host of differentiating functionality into our smart contract,including:\n\n    -Built in vesting to stop dumping and front running\n\n    -An interactive vesting dashboard with time-based vesting schedules\n\n   - An un-vested lottery dapp that burns tokens as holders play\n\n    -Max-buy and anti-whale technology, including blacklists\n\n\n\n\nAll tokens are vested for a short period meaning bots and frontrunners cannot intervene or dump the token price in one go.  You will not see large scale wallet unloading as it is not possible.\n\nSupply: 1,000,000,000,000 \n    \nTeam: 40,000,000,000 (10% TGE  remaining after 4 weeks)\nAdvisors: 20,000,000,000 (10% TGE  remaining after 4 weeks)\nPre-Sale: 462,500,000,000 \nMarketing: 15,000,000,000 \nLiquidity: 462,500,000,000 \n\nPresale raise is 25 eth, 50 slots at 0.5 eth each.  \nPresalers at TGE are 75% vested. 25% is released on TGE the rest is released 2 weeks after TGE, every 2 weeks\n\n\u26a0\ufe0fMuskRat Tokenomics Rules:\n\n- You can never sell or buy more than the max transaction limit. This limit will start off very low to deter botting and be increased later.\n\n- You can perform your first sell at any time you choose. The amount you can sell will be 25% of your total holdings. If 25% of your total holdings is more than the max transaction, then the max transaction will be your sell limit.\n \n- Every subsequent sell will be vested for 120 mins, where after you can sell another 25%.\n\n- Once you hit 10% of the max transaction limit, you are no longer vested and can sell your entire stack in one go.\n\n- While you are vested you can buy more. Buying more does not affect your vesting in any way, but it does boost the 25% amount that you will be entitled to sell later.\n\n\u2757\ufe0fMuskRat Tips:\n\n- Time your first sell well as this will be the only time you're not vested and hold a substantial amount.\n\n- When the end of your vesting is approaching you can buy more MuskRat to boost the 25% amount you can sell next.\n\n- Always use the MuskRat dashboard at https://www.muskrat.fund/dashboard/ to get all your vesting details, including the exact maximum amount you can sell when the current vesting ends, or if you are vested at all.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf MuskRat Lottery:\n\nFor every sell 1% is converted to ETH and sent to the lottery.\n\nWhile you are vested you can still play the lottery. Each lottery ticket costs 200,000,000 MuskRat. On each spin you have a 1 in 1000 chance of winning the lottery holdings. \n\nYour MuskRat lottery ticket will be burned.\n\nTo the moon! \ud83d\ude80\n\n\u2705 Website: muskrat.fund/\n\u2705 Telegram: @musk_rat\n\u2705 Twitter:  @MuskRat_Fund",

As the MC increases more giveaways will happen with larger Prizes.\n\n- Whitepaper / Audit soon\n\n- Aim to get listed on CEX ASAP.\n\n- Team is always working hard to deliver and everything so far has been self-funded by the Dev.\n\nCons:\nThe only real issue currently is the marketing delays which are out of our control as creators have been late so no more specific time frames will be given now to avoid dissapointment.\n\nNeeds people fluent in other languages to help spread the word to non english speakers (chinese, russian etc.)\n\n\nWhat their platform is going to offer:\n\nCams\nIt\u2019s just as the name suggests. Your favourite amateur stars on webcam hosted by $CUMINU. Models will be booked and tipped in $CUMINU tokens. $CUMINU will charge a 10% transaction fee.\n\nContent\nModels will be able to host a profile on $CUMINU that has a range of unlockable content. These will include photos and videos, private message requests and even NFTs.\n\nAma's\nPlans to host fortnightly AMA (ask me anything) with the biggest names in the industry. The sessions will have tiered membership determined by number of $CUMINU in the holder\u2019s wallet. Viewers will be able to purchase $CUMNIU before the AMA and tip the model throughout the session.\n\nTokenomics / Burn\nThey are going to charge 10% on all transactions through the site. Then use those funds to buy back the $CUMINU and burn them. This makes the token deflationary. OnlyFans isn't for all the degens as you have to give ID and hand over your credit card details. Being able to visit these sites and tip in crypto will be a big win. They\u2019re going to auction NFT's of the models during the AMAs. There are some crazy fans out there.\n\nFor more information:\n\nChart: https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0x7b412f141996411401f57e2ba1bc2235af807d4d\n\nWebsite: http://cuminu.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/CumInuToken\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CumInuToken\n\nUniswap: https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xd6327ce1fb9d6020e8c2c0e124a1ec23dcab7536",

    "text": "Who wants to feel WINTER \u2744 while going to MOON \ud83c\udf15 and BEYOND\ud83d\ude80?\n\nWinter Moon currently has innovative utility as financial instrument, with future use-cases in the works.\n\nWinterMoon is a hyper-deflationary currency with automated reflection and liquidity, granting it unique properties. For each transaction, there is a 6 percent tax. Half of that tax, 3 percent, is redistributed to all other WinterMoon holders in the form of reflection. The remaining 3 percent is used for liquidity.\n\n   These \"tokenomics\" aid price stability and incentivizes holding for several reasons:\n\n1\u00ba The burning of tokens creates a constriction on supply.\n\n2\u00ba The transaction tax creates a disincentive to sell.\n\n3\u00ba During periods of high-volume volatility, more reflections are distributed.\n\n4\u00ba It is far more costly and difficult for day-traders to artificially manipulate the price.\n\n  Overall, think of WinterMoon as a high-yield financial instrument, like an ETF, that leverages taxation on volume to provide a percentage yield to its holders. All of this makes WinterMoon an excellent store of value. The fact that it automatically allocates liquidity is just icing on the cake.\n\nIn addition, new utility is in the works, such as NFTs and gaming. And because WinterMoon has very high liquidity, this unlocks incredible DeFi potential (e.g., lending) aimed to provide financial services for the unbanked -- which is 1/3 of the world's population.\n\n   All of this makes for a winning formula: powerful tokenomics that grant exciting current and future utility. \u2744 \ud83c\udf15 \ud83c\udf40\ud83d\ude80\n\n   Fair Launching at 100 members on Telegram!!

During the years, banks have traditionally paid out different interest rates to those who keep their money in deposits. In other words \u2013 you receive a certain annualized interest for keeping your money deposited in a bank.\n\nYield farming in the DeFi space is similar to this. Users lock their funds with a specific protocol (like Compound, Balancer, etc.), which then lends it to people who need to borrow at a certain interest rate. In return, the platform would give those who lock their funds rewards and sometimes also share a part of the fees with them for providing the loan.\n\nThe earnings that lenders receive through interest rates and fees are less significant. The units of new crypto tokens from the lending platform takes the cake when it comes to real payoff. When the crypto lender\u2019s token value rises, the user will make a larger amount of profits.\n\n# The Beginning\n\nOur vision is to create one single application that can serve all your DEFI needs - and of course it startes with farming because we all love yield. But our goal is to provide sustainable yield and support. As a project, our primary focus is to provide safe and sustainable solutions that solve the hardest problems in the space. We don't commit code unless we know it's safe, and we don't commit code unless we believe it somehow creates utility for **WOLF** holders - the fuel that runs the **POLYWOLF**. As you know, wolves always stick together as a group and led by an **Alpha**, the **Alpha Wolf**. **Alpha** is also a term used to refer to ways to get the best yield and hidden features. We will be your **Alpha** **Wolf** and guide you to through the best possible experience. One ecosystem that unleashes the potential of crypto and **one token** to empower the ecosystem. Farming is just the beginning, we intend to give you multiple tools to empower your yield ! Our ultimate goal is to be an AMM when enough liquidity allows it. The AMM will have 0.25% fee on swap, **0.07%** of that will go towards **buying back and burn** WOLF token. Yes, we want to create a stable environment for our wolves.\n\n# Why Polygon?\n\nWe chose to build on Polygon because it has the fastest and cheapest decentralized transactions in the space. It is not by chance, but rather by careful consideration. We believe **the future lies in layer 2**, both in terms of fees and scaling, and that layer 2 will be the catalyst for mass adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe current price for a transaction on Polygon (Matic) is in the 1000th of penny. **Even with 10000 transactions, you still won\u2019t pass 1 USD.** It is unmatched. That makes PolyWolf a very profitable place to stake or farm the tokens that are built on Polygon, you don't need to pay 100s of USD on fees ! As we said this is just the beginning, in Q2 alone, we are creating more features like lotteries, NFTs, yield aggregation extraction and our best feature **WolfSwap** in order to strengthen our ecosystem and all the WOLVES. Join us in the revolution that is trading, farming and building on layer 2, and get the best possible yield after you have invested in a Polygon based project.",

A continuous burn on any one protocol can be nice in the early days, however, this means the burn cannot be finite or controlled in any way.\n\n Having burns controlled by the team and promoted based on achievements helps to keep the community rewarded and informed. The conditions of the automatically burn and the amounts can be advertised and tracked. \n\nTHREESOME  aims to implement a burn strategy that is beneficial and rewarding for those engaged for the long term. Furthermore, the total number of $THREESOME burned is featured on our readout located on the website which allows for further transparency in identifying the current circulating supply at any given point of time. \n\n **Automatic Liquidity Pool (LP)**\n\n Automatic LP is the secret sauce of $THREESOME . Here we have a function that acts as a two-fold beneficial implementation for holders. First, the contract sucks up tokens from sellers and buyers alike, and adds them to the LP creating a solid price floor.\n\n Second, the penalty acts as an arbitrage resistant mechanism that secures the volume of $THREESOME as a reward for the holders. In theory, the added LP creates a stability from the supplied LP by adding the tax to the overall liquidity of the token, thus increasing the tokens overall LP and supporting the price floor of the token. \n\nThis is different from the burn function of other reflection tokens which is only beneficial in the short term from the granted reduction of supply. As the $THREESOME token LP increases, the price stability mirrors this function with the benefit of a solid price floor and cushion for holders. \n\nThe goal here is to prevent the larger dips when whales decide to sell their tokens later in the game, which keeps the price from fluctuating as much as if there was no automatic LP function. All of this is an effort to alleviate some of the troubles we have seen with the current DeFi reflection tokens. \n\nContract Address: 0xf5ad59380483b21f2bb3d87af80642e10c971d2e\n\n Purchase on PanCakeSwap: [https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xf5ad59380483b21f2bb3d87af80642e10c971d2e](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xf5ad59380483b21f2bb3d87af80642e10c971d2e)\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/ThreesomeOfficial](https://t.me/ThreesomeOfficial)\n\nWe are confident that this model and protocol will prevail over the outdated reflection tokens for these reasons.",

    "text": "Launched about 2 days ago on pancakeswap!\n\nSmartMinds is a BSC token that donates to tiny educational charities in order to help the planet. SmartMinds wishes to provide opportunities to underprivileged youngsters so that they can grow up and receive the education that every child deserves. As a result, I believe this initiative has a lot of potential.\n\nThis objective begins with the community; the more individuals there are, the more people they can aid, and since this is a deflationary token created on its community, it's critical that everyone is involved and informed.\n\nI believe that by working together, we can make this happen, but you should always do your own research before investing your money.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n\\- Telegram: [https://t.me/SmartMindsCoinn](https://t.me/SmartMindsCoinn)\n\n\\- Website: [https://www.smartmindscoin.com](https://www.smartmindscoin.com/)\n\n\\- [https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x9dadf5cce94ae1deb3db329f2bf44d3301b0619e](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x9dadf5cce94ae1deb3db329f2bf44d3301b0619e)\n\n\\- Locked liquidity, renounced ownership, so there is no way the value is not climbing.

    "text": "Would like to talk about a new token coming out on Friday, June 4th called **SIAMESE NEKO $SIAM**. We started with a few of us trying to understand the world of blockchains, dealing with the losses of rug pulls and honey pots, reviewing charity tokens, and overall the cryptocurrency space. We decided that it was time to create our own coin and to start the rise of the cat coins! As someone on our team had a siamese in their life, and it is one of the most recognizable cats, we decided it was time to start it!\n\nRamping up a token is rough with so much noise and scams out there that we wanted to ensure we have a solid foundation going forward. **We started with a DxSale on Monday, May 31st and have reached our cap of 100 BNB in less than 2 days.** The minimum was .05 with a maximum of .2 - we kept this low because we wanted a swell of people to be part of this community. As we hit our hard cap, we are looking at **500+ holders.** This has exceeded our expectations and cannot wait for our launch on **Friday, June 4th at 9AM EST on PancakeSwap**. This early pre-sale was done through word of mouth, friends, family, and communities we are part of today. We truly believe in working with partners that understand our vision and hopefully are interested by having this our coin going forward.\n\n**DxSale:** [https://dxsale.app/app/pages/defipresale?saleID=2424&chain=BSC](https://dxsale.app/app/pages/defipresale?saleID=2424&chain=BSC)  \n\n\u2705**Softcap:** 50 BNB \u00a0\n\n\u2705**Hardcap:** 100 BNB\n\nRewarding holders and pushing to the LP automatically is important for early stage growth of $SIAM. 2% go to holders, 5% go automatically to the LP. \u00a0\n\nTo help grow during the first 100 days that are truly critical, **we are streaming live each day on Twitch at 8AM EST and for the next 100 days after launch.** On there, we discuss the current state of the coin, topics/actions that need to be taken and answer any questions. On launch day, we will be streaming the calling the sale final, this will then release $SIAM to those that took part in the pre-sale and will be available on PancakeSwap. Once that is released, we will be burning 20% of the coin (200,000,000,000), transferring the Community / Dev coins to their respective wallets, and answering any questions. Going forward, we will be burning 10% of $SIAM (100,000,000,000) over 100 days leaving the total circulating supply of 70% (700,000,000,000), taking 3% of the LP, burning the $SIAM coins, taking the BNB and splitting it 3 ways - 40% to charity wallet, 40% to holders on stream, 20% for SIAMESE NEKO team for buybacks, community, and marketing.\n\n**Quick Info:**\n\nSiamese Neko token is a community-driven cryptocurrency with daily active burns, rewards for holders, and donations to world wide causes.

As we see it is just a waste of resources to invest in something with no engagement and user experience.\n\n\n RPX is the plan to provide the solution to this problem. The engagement from the game where users can use to engage in various token games. It is designed to inject gamification into the current blockchain ecosystem by starting with the commonly known game of rock, paper & scissors. \nThe goal of the project is to rapidly build a game-based token that users and owners can engage with as a means of entertainment while rewarding the user with economic reward and engagement based on the underlying value of the asset (RPX Token). \n\nWe will also add liquidity at 2 contract to avoid bot attacking us.\n\nTG:\nhttps://t.me/rpxbsc\n\nWebsite:\nhttps://rockpaperx.com/\n\nInstagram:\nhttps://instagram.com/rockpaper.x\n\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/rpxbsc \n\nRockPaperX\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\nLaunching soon!\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

    "text": "Morphose - Make your transactions private on BSC while earning up to 200% APR in $MORPH - App is Live & Audited & Used daily - Polygon launch next month - $MORPH 48x ATH in CG CMC already, currently in the Dip if you Want to Get in on a HUGE Discount.\n\nMorphose is a fully decentralized private transactions protocol on Binance Smart Chain. $MORPH is a 100K low supply token that is currently on sale.\ud83d\udc8e\n\nThe team has lined up some big moves lately. The team lately introduced Staking with up to 200% APR to make protocol usage free for MORPH holders. Polygon launch is next month on July 10th, Fantom launch is in August, and Cardano launch is in September.\n\nMorphose is not a shitcoin or meme token without any use. She is an advanced BNB mixer with real use, and it is being used! Morphose is proven with 1000 BNBs passed through the protocol so far in 2 months since the launch.\n\nThe main distinction of Morphose from protocols like Tornadocash is Morphose doesn't involve any third party (relayer) in the process. This is why Morphose is more private, uses lower gas fees, and has lower commissions. She is also free to use for $MORPH holders.\n\nBig moves only at Morphose! After hitting 48x ATH, thanks to this bear market, $MORPH has lost some paper hands. Now is your chance to get in early on your next Homerun with at least 10X potential. However, when it's time, you won't have to sell. \ud83d\udc8e\n\nHere are the key distinctions of Morphose:\n\n\\- The Complete opposite of a shitcoin. Not a clone. Completely ownerless and everything is renounced. Community-run. Extreme attention to detail and excellence. Here to stay forever!\n\n\\- 100K max token supply. 49500 circulating. No airdrops. No giveaways. Only lucky-few diamond-handed holders. All supply minted, locked 12 months to distribute monthly in small batches to be used in rewards, marketing, and development. All LP locked 12 months.\n\n\\- Collected 100 BNB in presale. 48x ATH from the presale price. 34x from listing price. CG, CMC, Livecoinwatch, Nomics complete.\n\n\\- First Audit with SMCAuditors complete. Second ABDK audit on the way. Agreed with Peckshield on the V2 version audit that includes combined staking, multiple tokens, and privacy token use.\n\n\\- New blockchain listings soon. Polygon in July, and Fantom in August, Cardano in September. Polkadot EVM-based parachains as they launch. Solana, before the new year. In every new launch, long-term $MORPH holders will get 50% off in the presale for creating liquidity.\n\n\\- Devs working on the v2 of the app and making Morphose protocol better and $MORPH the first privacy token on BSC.\n\n\\- Wide media coverage to cross-promote MORPH with new platform presales coming soon. Coingecko banner ads coming soon. AMBcrypto and Cointelegraph article coming soon. Just write \"Morphose\" on Reddit to see the action!. Constantly shared on Twitter. New Youtube videos coming soon.\n\n\\- Elegant website. Practical daily used app. Proven with 1000 BNB passed through the protocol. Detailed whitepaper and docs. Combined staking with 200% APR. Creative incentives to buy and hold $MORPH.\n\n\\- And a rockstar community of HODLers!\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e Morphose \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\n\nThe website with info: [https://morphose.cash](https://morphose.cash/)",

    "title": "$ELONPEG just launched, the first Elon-Pegged cryptocurrency on the BSC with an automatic, contract-enabled burn every time Elon tweets. Pre-sale hit 600 BNB hardcap in under 10 minutes. Big marketing spend incoming.",
    "text": "Hello r/cryptomoonshots! We are excited to announce a newly developed twist on deflationary tokens: ELONPEG. This token features the standard taxation/reflection mechanics (detailed below), but also an innovative framework for automatic burn: every time Elon tweets, the Burn Vault will automatically burn 0.5% of its supply. Just like USDT is pegged to the US Dollar, ElonPeg is literally pegged to that vomit-inducing moment when you realize Elon is on Twitter again.\nWEBSITE: https://elonpeg.com\n\nA quick note about me: My name is Sammy and I am one of the project founders. You\u2019ve probably seen me here talking about Fox Finance where I remain an advisor, but I\u2019ve teamed up with some amazing crypto-junkies to launch an LLC, and with it ElonPeg and its amazing automation capabilities.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 So, what makes ElonPeg special? \ud83d\udd25\nLet\u2019s get the basic tokenomics out of the way (also on the site):\n\u2022  9% tax on every transaction: 3% to holders, 3% to liquidity, 3% to marketing, events, and carbon offsetting\n\u2022  1 Trillion total supply, 500Bn has been sent to the BurnUponTweeting contract, and 420Bn will be up for grabs\n\u2022  The BurnUponTweeting contract (audited along with the token) which is called the Burn Vault starts with half the total supply. Every time Elon tweets, the function ElonTweeted(tweetId) is called, burning 0.5% (adjustable) of the Burn Vault supply.\n\u2022  In order to ensure the supply in the Burn Vault is still in circulation, all burn transfers will incur and pay out from the tax. Additionally, a \"reclaim\" function was added allowing a 2% withdrawal to the marketing wallet only every 50th Elon Tweet. It\u2019s doubtful it will ever be used unless begged to by the community for a major marketing/event push!\nBurnUponTweeting has been extensively tested in Testnet and we\u2019re all pretty excited about it. Elon Tweets are picked up within minutes, kicking off a process that burns the required amount, stores the tweet ID in the burn transaction record, and sends alerts to the Telegram channel. We also hope to have this retweet and announce on Twitter in the future. You can read more info on the site and lite paper at elonpeg.com\n\n\ud83e\ude90 What is happening RIGHT NOW? \ud83e\ude90\nThanks Elon for all the action last night! $75k token value already burned since we launched at 7pm UTC 03.06.21 Insane wallet-drop reflections for early holders with every Elon Tweet and automated burn.\n\u2705 Burn vault launched with 50% supply of \u201cstill in circulation\u201d ElonPeg.\n\u2705 0.5% of the Burn Vault is burned (automated and contract bound) every time Elon Tweets - including share and reply. \n\u2705 Burn wallet reflection rewards are currently turned off. That\u2019s a 50% stake, recieving nothing. Which means huge token reflection wallet-drops every tweet for early holders.\n\nWe had no idea that we would smash our 600bnb presale hardcap yesterday within 10minutes, but now we can utilise unlocked liquidity (20%) for explosive marketing without selling any ElonPeg from our marketing wallet (thus dumping price). \nWe have given the nod to our marketing guys and this is powering ahead full steam. Influencers will need 24/48 hours to prepare content. We are now paying for big ad banners and website promotions and aiming to get these out asap. We are applying for CMC/CG today, and we want to get this out quickly. \n\n\ud83e\ude90\ud83e\ude90\ud83e\ude90\nWatch out later today for Twitter-integrated burn reports linked to Elon\u2019s tweets, contract-bound, visible on the blockchain. Bring the burn. \ud83d\udd25\nLastly, we have formed a ShillX group for people who want to be active and get involved at an early stage. We will be incentivising and rewarding participants. Whilst we ramp up marketing, we need your support. \nhttps://t.me/joinchat/r9PWtxYIb7ZlZDEx\n\n\ud83d\udc40 How safe is this? \ud83d\udc40",

Website is launched but a new version is launching soon...\n\nWe will be having a presale to build funds for the liquidity and to get this token up and running! \n\nThe presale will be starting when we get 100 members in our telegram group so join with the link below \u2b07\ufe0f\n\nThe minimum buy on the presale will be 0.05 BNB and the max buy is 0.5BNB this prevents whales in the early stages of the token.\n\nAfter the presale the token will be available to buy on Pancake Swap. Contract will be released soon.\n\nThe team has great plans for marketing the token and is in talks with influencers on Instagram and TikTok so get in early before this blows up!\n\n\nTokenomics:\n\n\u2022  Total supply - 100,000,000,000 \n\n\u2022  50% of supply is burned\n   \n\u2022  Liquidity Locked \ud83d\udd12 \n\n\u2022   Rug Proof\n\n\u2022    5% of transaction goes to liquidity pool and               another 5% gets redistributed to the holders. \n\n\nWe have a very active Telegram group and are there to answer any questions you may have about the project!\n\nTelegram -> t.me/enviro_token\n\nWebsite -> http://envirotoken.webflow.io",

We don\u2019t perceive ticket forging or resale to an unintended recipient as an issue. The threats associated with the wrong people accessing your event are, unfortunately, known. From sexual harassment to active shooter occurrences, tracing tickets could give potential intelligence to avoid unwanted individuals to gain access.\n\n\ud83d\udd3aThis makes blockchain ticketing very appealing for events that have security in mind and want to be able to have stricter control over who gains access to the event.\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/DigityMoon](https://t.me/DigityMoon)\n\n\ud83d\udcc8Tokenomics \ud83d\udcc8\n\nTotal Supply: 800,000,000\n\nMax Hold: 1%\n\nTax: 10\n\n\ud83d\udcb0Anti Dumping \ud83d\udcb0\n\n20% for the first 1st Hour\n\n10% normal taxation (LP and holders)\n\n\ud83d\ude94 Roadmap \ud83d\ude94\n\nPhase 1: Soft Launch\n\n\u2022Fair Launch of Token (No Presale)\n\n\u2022Whitepaper\n\n\u2022Website Launch\n\n\u2022Pancakeswap listing\n\n\u2022Social Media Platforms\n\n\u2022Coinhunt, Coinsniper, Freshcoins applications\n\n\u2022Poocoin Ads\n\n\u2022Coingecko listing\n\n\u2022Community AMA\n\n\u2022Teaser of DigityMoon app (BETA)\n\nPhase 2\n\n\u2022Official Launch of Upgraded Website (V2)\n\n\u2022Launch of DigityMoon Merch / Fundraising NFT's\n\n\u2022DigityMoon BETA release\n\n\u2022Devs and team will doxx\n\n\u2022CMC listing\n\n\u2022Social Media Campaigns\n\n\u2022AMA with a vast audience group\n\nPhase 3:\n\n\u2022Whitebit listing\n\n\u2022Hotbit listing\n\n\u2022Certik Audit\n\n\u2022Marketing campaign commences\n\n\u2022Applications to larger CEX's (TBA)\n\nPhase 4:\n\n\u2022DigityMoon1.0 Official public release\n\n\u2022Much more, to be confirmed.\n\nWhitepaper can be found on the website.\n\n\u2705Links:\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/DigityMoon](https://t.me/DigityMoon)",

      "Disclaimer. These memecoin BSC launches work in one of two ways.\n\n1) the liquidity lock proof they post is total bogus, and/or the developers have huge wallets they can dump on you - but if you take the time to check, you\u2019ve missed the chance to buy early at launch, and the quick 5X gain that happens before the rug is gone.\n\n2) the liquidity lock is real, and the developers don\u2019t own massive wallets they can dump on you, but because you took the time to check that out, you\u2019ve also missed the quick gains. Then the people who did get in early dump after 5-10X.\n\nWhy does it work? Every month one or two of these things takes off, for reasons nobody really understands. One or two out of thousands launching every week. You\u2019d be better off putting it all on red at the casino.",

After all that, if the project hasn't died yet, wait for the big dip from impatient holders, and then make your entry (not advice, just what I do).

    "text": "Here is my take on why I expect NWC 2.0 to reach the moon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo War Coin 2.0 is a long-term charity coin designed to generate donations which will be given to organizations aimed at helping those in areas troubled by war. You can help people from war torn countries by buying and holding No War Coin. It is a deflationary, anti-whale, anti-bot charity coin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe team is continuously working on improving the anti-bot features to stay ahead of trading bots and has partnered up with a well-known blockchain developer. So far NWC has been able to successfully block over a 1000 transaction attempts from trade bots. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Liquidity is locked and the developer is doxed**. The team consists of dedicated and highly experienced marketeers, developers and community moderators. The community consists of more than 3000 members and is continuing to grow at a rapid pace. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith each transaction a % is added to the charity wallet, which currently stands at around 100 bnb. The community votes on which charity this amount will be spent. After 30 days a new charity is selected and the process starts again. Currently, Red Cross and Doctors without borders have been picked for potential organizations to donate to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ROADMAP :\n\n*Continuous ongoing improvements to block bots from trading NWC* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**June:**\n\nMonth of June 2021: Ongoing big name influencer campaign\n\n2nd of June 2021: Applied for CMC and CG listing\n\n3rd of June 2021: Applied for source code audit with techrate\n\n4th of June 2021: AMA with Aaron Mamuyac\n\n5th of June 2021: AMA with Crypto Eagles\n\n6th of June 2021: AMA on Twitch TV\n\n18-21 June 2021: First donation \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**July:**\n\nImproved website launch\n\nLaunch of NWC clothing brand \n\nCharity NFT launch\n\nPartnerships + marketing\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tokenomics:\n\nMax. supply: 1 quadrillion\n\nInitial burn: 0.4 quadrillion\n\nTx tax:\n\n1.5% Charity\n\n0.5% Redistribution\n\n1% Auto Liquidity\n\n0.5% Burn\n\n1.5% Marketing and Development\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Liquidity locked forever:**\n\n[https://dxsale.app/app/pages/dxlockview?id=0&add=0xDd818fC6A942828b4F8cD7f067c0D8b6e9687B54&type=lplock&chain=BSC](https://dxsale.app/app/pages/dxlockview?id=0&add=0xDd818fC6A942828b4F8cD7f067c0D8b6e9687B54&type=lplock&chain=BSC)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Charity wallet:**\n\nCharity wallet currently at 93 bnb!:\n\n[https://bscscan.com/address/0xe5a5c89cd052c9154f7b69abc28373f79c0340c4](https://bscscan.com/address/0xe5a5c89cd052c9154f7b69abc28373f79c0340c4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Whitepaper:**\n\n[https://www.nowarcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/WhitePaperV2.0-updated.pdf](https://www.nowarcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/WhitePaperV2.0-updated.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Other links:\n\n**\ud83d\udcf1 Telegram:** [**https://t.me/NoWarCoinAntiBot**](https://t.me/NoWarCoinAntiBot)\n\n**\ud83d\udcf1 Website:** [**https://www.nowarcoin.com/**](https://www.nowarcoin.com/)\n\n**\ud83d\udcf1 Twitter:** [**https://twitter.com/NoWarCoin1**](https://twitter.com/NoWarCoin1)\n\n**\ud83d\udcf1 Tiktok:** [**https://www.tiktok.com/@nowarcoinbsc**](https://www.tiktok.com/@nowarcoinbsc)\n\n**\ud83d\udcf1 Twitch:** [**https://www.twitch.tv/nowarcoin**](https://www.twitch.tv/nowarcoin)\n\n**\ud83d\udcf1 PCS:** [**https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xc6274cd1609bc8a29f2718de5c8e8872b98863d5**](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xc6274cd1609bc8a29f2718de5c8e8872b98863d5)",

From sexual harassment to active shooter occurrences, tracing tickets could give potential intelligence to avoid unwanted individuals to gain access.\n\n\ud83d\udd3aThis makes blockchain ticketing very appealing for events that have security in mind and want to be able to have stricter control over who gains access to the event.\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/DigityMoon](https://t.me/DigityMoon)\n\n\ud83d\udcc8Tokenomics \ud83d\udcc8\n\nTotal Supply: 800,000,000\n\nMax Hold: 1%\n\nTax: 10\n\n\ud83d\udcb0Anti Dumping \ud83d\udcb0\n\n20% for the first 1st Hour\n\n10% normal taxation (LP and holders)\n\n\ud83d\ude94 Roadmap \ud83d\ude94\n\nPhase 1: Soft Launch\n\n\u2022Fair Launch of Token (No Presale)\n\n\u2022Whitepaper\n\n\u2022Website Launch\n\n\u2022Pancakeswap listing\n\n\u2022Social Media Platforms\n\n\u2022Coinhunt, Coinsniper, Freshcoins applications\n\n\u2022Poocoin Ads\n\n\u2022Coingecko listing\n\n\u2022Community AMA\n\n\u2022Teaser of DigityMoon app (BETA)\n\nPhase 2\n\n\u2022Official Launch of Upgraded Website (V2)\n\n\u2022Launch of DigityMoon Merch / Fundraising NFT's\n\n\u2022DigityMoon BETA release\n\n\u2022Devs and team will doxx\n\n\u2022CMC listing\n\n\u2022Social Media Campaigns\n\n\u2022AMA with a vast audience group\n\nPhase 3:\n\n\u2022Whitebit listing\n\n\u2022Hotbit listing\n\n\u2022Certik Audit\n\n\u2022Marketing campaign commences\n\n\u2022Applications to larger CEX's (TBA)\n\nPhase 4:\n\n\u2022DigityMoon1.0 Official public release\n\n\u2022Much more, to be confirmed.\n\nWhitepaper can be found on the website.\n\n\u2705Links:\n\nTelegram: [https://t.me/DigityMoon](https://t.me/DigityMoon)",

    "text": "After a succesful presale (200bnb in 4 minutes), the first lottery kicked in. Countdown went from 6 hours to 2 hours right now. \n\nThe current prize is 85bnb to be split between the last 7 buyers. 2 hours left in countdown.\n\nA countdown is running, once it's over, the last 7 buyers win a jackpot. It\u2019s paid instantly in BNB, avoiding the price dump dynamic after lottery is paid on other tokens.\n\nOne second is added to the countdown for every 5,000 token purchased. So price action not only increases lottery but also push it back.\n\nThe dev team can tweak some of these variables, they\u2019ll run polls weekly to let the community decide on what should be done.\n\n\nThe lottery fee on each transaction is 2% (+3% additional fee if lottery countdown is less than 1 hour)\n\nThe tokenomics are also nice, classic safemoon/bonfire reflection and LP. Holders benefit from the price action:\n\n- 3% Liquidity pool fee\n\n- 5% redistribution to holders. You can see your balance increase just by holding\n\n- 50% supply burned. 0xdead gets reflection so more burn.\n\n\nTo participate in the lottery you just need to buy 10,000 tokens, if you're good in timing you'd get in the last 7 buyers.\n\nThe countdown + lottery prize and website \ud83d\udc49 https://www.luckinutoken.com/\n\nContract: https://bscscan.com/address/0xB2f7e860E302b18819970ceA41BcFc7349834e81#code\n\nBuy on pancake:\nhttps://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xB2f7e860E302b18819970ceA41BcFc7349834e81\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/luckinutoken\n\nLiquidity locked: https://dxsale.app/app/pages/defipresale?saleID=2698&chain=BSC\n\ndev wallet locked: https://dxsale.app/app/pages/dxlockview?id=0&add=0xA3F1f7D23D1fFb0143991a5e50bE4cd1B0dc5cD7&type=tokenlock&chain=BSC\n\nOwnership renounced: https://bscscan.com/tx/0x1ced850a671d204de031e452b7739e963487cd711ab99814ba24ba96ccbf9ea3#eventlog\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/luckinu",
