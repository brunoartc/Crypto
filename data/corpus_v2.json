Highly recommend picking up some RX and stake here to reap the rewards. There is a live AMA voice recording available in their Telegram group from yesterday as well that will answer many questions! (https://bscscan.com/block/countdown/7988405)\n\nWith so many concerns about flash loan attacks, this platform is hosted internally and is not vulnerable to the attacks launched on Pancakeswap. Funds are safu! But what\u2019s even better, Flame Finance is developing a way to incorporate reflection into its stoves/ovens, so those who stake can still earn the passive rewards that come with most BSC tokens. This should be live within a few weeks and could be a huge game changer!\n\nRavenX has also launched a fantastic lottery that will be drawn every Saturday, with the winner taking home 20% of the prize pool. There some super big developments coming to the lottery within a couple of weeks as well to add greater value and price growth, so it is in its V1 phase at the moment. However, it\u2019s a great way to multiply your funds and contribute towards some very exciting moves for the project- check the pinned TG announcements to see! (http://lottery.ravenxapi.xyz). You don\u2019t even need to hold RX to join the lottery, though, so anyone can enter with up to 1 BNB (100 tickets). Each 0.01 BNB equates to 1 entry!\n\nThe market cap for RavenX is just over $2M, while Flame Finance is just under $100k! This is a super exciting opportunity to get into both projects, with the added benefit of a Certik audit for RavenX and strong support from Binance Charity for its charitable donations.\n\nSee the most recent tweet here: https://mobile.twitter.com/BinanceBCF/status/1397614767527796737\n\nAnd Certik audit here: \nhttps://www.certik.org/projects/ravenx\n\n2% of each transaction go to charity, 2% get burned, and 2% get redistributed to the holders.\n\nCEX listings: Whitebit\nCMC: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/raven-x/\nWebsite: https://ravenxapi.xyz\nRavenDex: https://dex.ravenxapi.xyz/#/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ravenxfin\nRaven X Official Telegram: https://t.me/ravenxfin\nFlame Finance Official Telegram: https://t.me/flam3finance\nLocked liquidity: https://dxsale.app/app/pages/dxlockviewv1?id=1047&add=0&type=lpdefi&chain=BSC", "created_utc": 1622753192.0, "num_comments": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "score": 400, "is_original_content": false, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "comments": ["The Raven community is growing!

They have a lot more  to go. they're not even on one  exchange yet but hinted about being in a  top 5 exchange as soon as next  week.\n\nLooks  like everyone wants  to join the party, and the afterparty!

Bitcoin 2021 is   being touted as the biggest bitcoin event in history with all tickets   already sold out!

I found one in Amnext.\n\nAmnext takes saving money to a whole new level by turning it into an interesting venture, and that is done through the combination of smart contracts, DApps, and creativity. Amnext is a saving game where you are always a winner.\n\n**The main features of Amnext are:**\n\n* *Lifetime Lottery Ticket*\n* *No-Loss Lottery*\n* *Staking Rewards*\n* *Referral Rewards*\n* *Rewards in AMC by depositing in Prize Pools*\n* *Doxxed Developers*\n* No Launch Until Audits are done (Certik as 1st chose)\n\nLifetime Lottery Overview:\n\nThe **Lifetime Lottery** follows an easy but smart procedure. Once a user buys the lifetime ticket the funds are sent to the **Amnext Staking protocol**, it will generate Interest.\n\nThis is where the magic happens. The interest produced is accrued to the to the lifetime jackpot depository which allows users to **keep their lottery tickets forever** without the necessity of putting in money repeatedly to participate on the drawing of the next lottery.\n\nIn simple terms, the money used to buy the tickets **does not become the jackpot** as it happens in classic/national lotteries but it is used to generate the interest, which will form the jackpot and allow **the birth of the lifetime ticket!**\n\nNo Loss Lottery Overview:\n\n**Another unbelievable concept** inside the Amnext ecosystem is the **No-Loss Prize Pools.**\n\nThe members can deposit funds in different stable and well-trusted Tokens like **BNB/CAKE/USDT/BUSD/VAI.**\n\nThe amount deposited follows the same workflow similar to the lifetime lottery protocol. The Tokens deposited are invested in one of the most active and secure platform of the Binance Smart Chain, **Venus a Lending and Borrow** Dapp that permits the invested tokens in Amnext to generate the interests which form the jackpots.\n\nInstead of the lifetime lottery, you can remove your investment whenever you want and accrue AMC tokens as a simple staking system. There is also a **bonus that is added to the jackpots,** the fabulous **LootBox;** a fair amount of AMC tokens that is provided by the tokenomics logic of the project.\n\nMy Review:\n\nThe confidence of the doxxing team is amazing and **should sell itself early enough**.

Holders earn passive rewards by holding Supermoon in proportion to the amount of tokens they hold.  \n \n2% to Liquidity  \n \nHealthy levels of liquidity will help reduce the price impact every time someone buys or sells. The feature will take 2% of every single transaction and add it to the liquidity pool, ensuring there is always enough liquidity for trading.  \n \n3% to Burn  \n \nBurning tokens will reduce the circulating supply over time, which may result in the value of the token increasing. About 3% of each transaction will go to a burn wallet, continuously reducing the circulating supply over time.  \n \nThese smart tokenomics can create a continuously rising price floor, and benefits early holders by growing their balance through static reflection.  \n \nWhat's in the Roadmap? \n \n\u25cf  NFT Marketplace  \n\u25cf  Astronaut Scholarship Program  \n\u25cf  iOS and Android Games \n\u25cf  Liquidity Farming  \n\u25cf  Payments App \n\u25cf  Merch\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Supermoon_Finance\n\nContract: 0xfAEFe2e0D056243060A6f640d5735CAE307001C4", "created_utc": 1622762718.0, "num_comments": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "score": 64, "is_original_content": false, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "comments": ["CMC #1 trending today!  13,500+ holders in 5 days!

We are a team of 3 based in The Netherlands. All of us are experienced in starting companies and executing them from concept to full product-market fit. \n\n**Now let me introduce D-Drops**\n\nD-Drops is a decentralised treasure hunt platform. Where a 5% transaction fee will reserve funds for the smart contract to create and distribute treasures all over the world. \n\nHolders of the DOP token can then search for treasure using the DApp. The holder will receive a radius in which the treasure can be found. Based on this users can open their cameras and explore the AR world created around the treasure. When a user finds the treasure, they can send a claim request to the smart contract and claim the contents of the treasure. \n\nThe treasure creation and distribution system is based on the following parameters: Price of DOP, DOP volume traded, GEO location holders. \n\nFor now, D-Drops is currently busy with Phase One of the project. \n\nDuring Phase One, we will be focused on growing the community and raising enough funds to build the DApp D-Drops. D-Drops will start organising physical drops during phase one. This introduces the concept and enables holders of DOP to already pick the fruits of their investment.\n\n**Physical launch**\n\nThe first-ever Drop will be held in a spectacular fashion. D-Drops will be launching the first drop into space and drop it from there. Holders of the DOP token will be able to go treasure hunting for this drop and collect the contents of the treasure.\n\n**Launch Paper** \n\nA detailed description of how we will exactly execute the physical launch is written in our official [*launchpaper.*](https://ddrops.world/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/D-Drops_Launchpaper.pdf) \ud83d\udcc3\n\n**Contents of the Drop**\n\nThe content of the drops will exist out of BNB and a Unique NFT specially created for the event in collaboration with a 3D/NFT artist.

The burn wallet also accumulates Reflection/Redistribution tokens like any other Glitchy wallet, and those are manually burned to create a constant slow deflation of supply.\n\nAccumulating LP Tokens are manually burned as soon as they accumulate to approximately 10% of the available liquidity.\n\nGLITCHY fairly rewards holders with accumulating BNB rewards. No other reward token accumulates rewards. Reward Cycles are regenerated weekly and unclaimed rewards are held safely for the individual wallets they are assigned to. NEVER LOSE YOUR REWARD. SMALL HOLDERS \u2013 ACCUMULATE AND DON\u2019T OVERPAY GAS FEES\n\n**WHY GLITCHY?? Because Holders are Rewarded Fairly:**\n\nOther BNB Reward tokens penalize those who forget to claim, are unable to claim, or in the case of small stakeholders, when the gas fee to make the claim transaction outweighs the reward. Most of these tokens require users to claim daily \u2013 if these rewards are not claimed, they are typically redistributed to the other holders who in time can lay claim to them. This creates a disproportionate system where only the savvy or whale holders truly benefit. Glitchy\u2019s foundational concept is fairness to all holders, whether crypto veterans or noobs, whales or small fish.\n\nGlitchy does not require users to claim in every cycle. Users BNB claims are distributed in proportion to their percentage of holdings of the total Glitchy supply, and the rewards generated every week belong entirely to the wallet that holds the Glitchy. BNB REWARDS ACCUMULATE IF THEY ARE NOT CLAIMED. For example, if a user were entitled to .5BNB Rewards in Week 1, chose not to claim, then was entitled to 1BNB in Week 2 and chose to claim, the entire reward would be 1.5BNB.\n\nThe fundamental difference between Glitchy and other reward tokens on the market now is that Glitchy allows flexibility in the claim function and ensures that claims are never lost or taken by other holders. No other token does rewards like Glitchy.\n\n**No-Lock, No-Stake, No-Penalty:**\n\nGlitchy does not require any external staking or locking of funds in order to generate rewards. Your Glitchy stays exactly where it should \u2013 in your wallet, earning all the time. As explained above, BNB Rewards are never penalized (except in the case of a sell, where your percentage of holding decreases and Rewards will decrease accordingly in the following claim cycle).\n\n**Community and Outreach:**\n\nGlitchy has built a strong holder community through Telegram and Twitter. There are dedicated team members in development, marketing, and Telegram customer service. With a global group of holders and team members, Glitchy is able to execute marketing campaigns and answer user questions 24/7.\n\nUpcoming Marketing Campaigns include additional Reddit/Twitter postings and giveaways, crypto-focused YouTube promotions, AMA\u2019s, and a redesign of the dApp with updated UI/UX.\n\nGlitchy is for Everyone.

Its called Gem Protocol and this project is only four days old and already listed on Coingecko recently and cmc is imminent. Gem did things a little different than most instead of making wild promises that they may or may not keep they made a utility and a real good one before launch. But that wasn't enough they made another. Here's an overview of Gems dapps:\nPortfolio Tracker - This one is truly revolutionary. It shows you every token in your wallet along with a dollar value and bnb value. I messaged the dev on day 1 and asked him to include a feature that also shows the contract address. And hours later he did. Most of the ones showing up as high amounts were rugs. But one of the tokens it showed (Saylormoon) I had bought a long time ago and forgotten about and was worth 100 bnb. I never would have known that if not for Portfolio tracker. Try it out for yourself instructions below.\nRug Screener - Gem Protocol has released a real good and completely free Rug screener you just copy and paste the code of the contract. It seems more comprehensive than bsc scan eu and is free unlike rugscreen. Additionally the devs have promised more features. They promise that while Gem dapps will always be free some of the new features will be only for holders. They are almost to 2500 hodlers so cmc and coingecko are imminent. Sitting below a $2m MC with a usable product this is a major find and early on. A direct competitor to Bogged and Poocoin at less than a penny on the dollar in market cap. This is truly amazing!\nInstructions to use: Open\u00a0www.gemprotocol.io\u00a0on your trust browser and choose an app it's as simple as that. LP is fully locked. Ownership is not renounced as this is an actual working utility but dev is not allowed to pull liquidity or mint new tokens merely administrative access to maintain the system and to do things the community wants. Just yesterday they changed slippage from 4% to 12% because too many whales were swinging the price. It is now stable after that. Those kinds of things aren't possible in a community token. Obviously dyor but how often do you find an actual working utility that's innovative and unlike anything else available (like Portfolio tracker) for under $2m market cap? You don't usually.

On The Melon App, we will not be able to exchange Likes with each other, but our cryptocurrency Melon. Each \"Like\" equals one Melon on the app, which goes directly to the content creator. No more annoying ads or different content to spamming our feeds. These Melons can be exchanged to fiat currency in real-time on our application. When you hold Melons, you will receive a constant appreciating amount through our Tokenomics.\n\n\u26a1\ufe0fTokenomics: \n\nThere will be a total of 50,000,000,000 Melons in Supply, from which we have already burnt 50%. We have chosen a relatively small total supply to grant fair rewards to content creators on their posts with Melons that actually have value. \n\nAdditionally, we have an 8% Fee for every Melon transaction. From that, 5% will be redistributed between all the Melon holders. The other 3% will be burnt and added forever to our automatic Liquidity Pool for the Token. Half of that will be kept in Melons, whereas the other half will immediately be kept in BNB. This ensures constant growth and less volatility. The dev team will keep 2% of the supply in the marketing & development wallet, locked for one month.\n\n\u2696\ufe0f  Fair DxSale Launch Soon: \n\nJoin the Melon Token before its official launch & benefit even more.

This powerful bot will be available from the dev team at Healing Potion via \"[@maverickhp](https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=%40maverickhp)\" or \"[@peach](https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=%40peach)\" or directly on TG with said handles.  \n\n\nFuture updates for the community bot will include a referral poll captcha which will allow TG group owners to collect data on the whereabouts their new members are arriving from. Great for validating your project marketing avenues!  \n\n\nThe Bot Yard  \nDuring this past week significant progress has been made on the bot marketplace \"The Bot Yard\" which includes the completion of the entire bot marketplace framework and trending TG channel listings. We decided to add the TG channel list to allow viewers direct access to TG channels that promote tokens releases. We have also offer some verified TG channels to assist in the community in their decision making process. There are a number of bot owners who are already expressing interest in listing on the site which is great news!  \n\n\nWe are also offering custom bot creation services for projects, feel free to reach out if your looking for a unique bot for your project.  \n\n\nThe Bot Yard is planned for release early July 2021!  \n\n\nCommunity  \nIn terms of community we are hosting an AMA tomorrow 7PM ET if you are interesting in attending. Our twitch podcast will also be recorded this coming Monday where we will be discussing a few hot topics in this space like the recent Volqan project, Ghostface and much more!  \n\n\nThe devs are also constructing the \"compendium\", which will be a reference of definitions available online for the community to access.

HODL'rs of NotSafeM\u043e\u043en will have access to advanced analytics built on top of the same system running byrdeBot, the Price Predicting Twitter Bot. View reflection gains, liquidity pool reserve balances, fee and reward exclusion data, \"m\u043e\u043en\" dev token and LP token balances, estimated time until a tokens liquidity dump, 'true' burn rate, and much more! Also shown in the video is the Bug Detector which will check any tracked token for an exploit which allows a dev to regain ownership of a renounced contract. More bugs will be continuously added to the detector, including the **flashloan exploit.** You can also easily link to the contract, buy link, and chart of any token being tracked on the dashboard. You can also **add your own custom tokens** which can instantly used with all these features. It is a bit choppy but please go check out the demo video now!!!  \n\n\nThe v1 version of the dashboard will be released any day this month, and there is some serious marketing planned to coincide the release of this powerful tool unlike anything currently available on BSC. This is your chance to pack your bags!!! This 1 month old token is now 80% below ATH.

Can We Trust SafeWojak\nWell, here\u2019s my 2 cents.\n\nThey have burnt almost all of their liquidity pool tokens. This is as safu as it gets in this minefield of a market.\n\nDev\u2019s are almost always available to answer my questions, and to a level of competency I can appreciate.\nProposed tools are in alpha testing, beyond the typical projects posted on BSC which are merely in the conceptual stages.\n \n3. Wojanomics\n5% Tax on transactions, where\n      3% Redistributed, to myself and all fellow Wojaks alike  \n      2% Development Fund, makes sense - they need some way to sustain the project\n\nAs mentioned earlier, they have burnt the LP, which is incredibly rare. Proof of this is on the BSC network. Just view their LP holders (easy way to find this is on PooCoin on the left).\n\n4.

Live on PCS [500K Market Cap]", "text": "**Market Cap at $500k and 1,500 Real HODLERS.**\n\nWebsite:\u00a0[www.eject.space](http://www.eject.space/)\n\nTelegram:\u00a0[https://t.me/EjectElonCommunity](https://t.me/EjectElonCommunity)\n\n**What Is Eject Elon (EJECT)?**\n\nEJECT will be the Kickstarter type crowdfunding platform built on the Binance smart chain. On EJECT, retail investors will find up and coming block-chain projects to invest in.\n\nInstead of private sales, presales, airdrops, audits and marketing being done separately by each individual team on a variety of platforms, EJECT will host each phase of the growth of a Coin.\n\n$EJECT is the native utility token that will be used for:\n\n**Developers:**\n\n* To Create and Launch projects\n\n**Investors:**\n\n* To back projects\n* To invest in projects\n* To trade $EJECT for the project's tokens or get rewarded in EJECT tokens\n\n**Why Will EJECT be The Next 500x Token?**\n\nUnlike many new projects, EJECT has a real world use-case RIGHT NOW! If you are a meme-coin/shit-coin investor, you know the drill. When making an investment decision, you have to:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1. Find projects that won't rugpull and those that won't be burnt to ashes 3 hours after launch.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2. Scout the Internet for decent upcoming pre-sales without there being any centralized hub to find them.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3. Leave a project as soon as you've 5x'd because you know they're mostly just pump and dumps.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4. Rely on the hype, telegram members, poocoin ads, the relentless Reddit spam to find these projects.\n\n**Right?**\n\nAnd that is why the future EJECT platform ALREADY has a ready market of hundreds, if not thousands of investors/ day traders/ moonshot hopefuls who are looking for a place where reliable information is conveniently available, and where investing is easy and safe!\n\n**The way things are RIGHT NOW:**\n\nUnder our noses, genuine developers with great projects and a vision go unnoticed because few con-men have learned the art of MARKETING and pulling the rug after launch.\n\nImagine a marketplace where the success of a new project is not decided by the marketing that goes into it, but the actual use-case? A place where you can access all the best new crypto projects, learn everything about them, interact through verified channels with the dev team, and invest with great convenience and speed if convinced by the project.\n\nThis also applies to shitcoins or memecoins because, as the community rules, any project that gets backing can see the light.\n\nOur care is for the best to come to the limelight, irrespective of shenanigans and marketing budgets. We propose to host AMAs on our website, where developers can discuss their ideas with investors, and impose an auditing process for all projects that want to get listed on EJECT.\n\n**How will EJECT achieve its goal?**\n\nEJECT will be a centralized platform where potential investors will be able to see the latest pre-audited projects. The EJECT token will be the currency for backing a project through their private sales or presales. EJECT will also manage airdrops and reward customers who stake EJECT tokens and complete shilling tasks.\n\nWith the EJECT token as the currency and a prerequisite for backing projects, there is a REAL world use case for $EJECT, thereby attracting more holders and elevating the price of the EJECT token.\n\n**When will EJECT Development start?**\n\nWe have started to document the project already. The development of the platform will start in late June 2021 and a beta version will likely be launched in early August 2021.\n\nThe platform will use the same type of safety mechanism that DxSale uses. No one, not even the platform developers, will be able to access the raised funds outside the rules and timelines agreed upon by investors and project leaders.\n\nCurrently, **EJECT has a Market Cap of $500K, with 1,500 REAL HOLDERS.**\n\nWebsite:\u00a0[www.eject.space](http://www.eject.space/)  \n\n\nTelegram:\u00a0[https://t.me/EjectElonCommunity](https://t.me/EjectElonCommunity)", "created_utc": 1622750746.0, "num_comments": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "score": 31, "is_original_content": false, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "comments": ["If you are considering putting your money into a small cap coin, you should really think about this one.

The tokenomics are genius and are unlike any other cryptocurrency in the market.\n\nThe growth of the token does not simply rely on supply and demand but rather the community\u2019s interest in investing into other assets. With a 10% fee for each transaction, 5 % automatically gets redistributed back to the holders in gains for holding. The other 5% goes to a separate wallet that will get converted into BNB and RE-INVESTED into other assets that will have a promising return, such as BitCoin, Real Estate and stocks, helping to diversify a growing portfolio for the investors. Then the profits of those assets will then periodically get redistributed back to the Liquidity Pool. Portfolio is not a token that gives away money or locks money up in a LP wallet, but rather looks to continue to invest money for long term gains in other lucrative markets.\n\nHolders get paid back 3X with this token: 5% from each transaction, another 5% when the investment wallet is converted to BNB to purchase investment assets, and then again by adding those profits back into the Liquidity Pool. Continuality adding to the LP this way will create a very stable token.\n\nThe first investments purchased will be Bitcoin and Ethereum. Taking advantage of the bear market to purchase the assets low with holders knowing the values are destined to increase. After investing into other cryptocurrency assets, PORTFOLIO will invest into real estate by working with REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST with the intent to partner with Grant Cardone and Cardone Capital.\n\nThis Token is going to take the world by storm as it is the ONLY token to allow its holders to invest into a crypto that is backed by profitable assets, ran as a business and pays the profits back to the holders!

Meaning the girls on the platform can earn up to 30% more in revenue. Its a no brainer for them to come onboard, and some big stars are already reaching out.\n\nCheck out the tokenomics further below to understand how the revenue made will be used to burn the Cuminu Tokens and ultimately increase the price of every token circulating making this very attractive for investors.\n\n- PornHub adverts starts within 24hrs (banners etc)\n\n- CMC: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cuminu/\n\n- $7M valuation\n\n- 90% Liquidity locked 2 years (no rug pull capable)\n\n- No 2%+ big wallets\n\n- Team tokens locked (they own 10%, 50% of that is locked for a month)\n\n- More than 30x until $CUMMIES Cum Rocket market cap.\n\n- Active interest from major influencers in the NSFW space.\n\n- Valid business model which allows us to deliver value to everyone involved\n\n- ETH chain for main coin (stability), BSC for currency (cheap transactions). Fees from tips burned into ETH chain. We charge our stars 50% less than any current platform. (10% versus OnlyFans 20%)\n\n- Some current models on board: Tasha Reign, Lacey London, Blair Williams, Allison Parker, Yvonne Bar, Bonnie Rotten.\n\n- Next model to be announced has 14m+ followers.\n\n- UpNextCrypto and TheCryptoRoom on youtube will be dropping a video on us as soon as theyre done.\n\n- TikTik Promos in the work.\n\n- In negotiations with a Stripper business in LA that owns 50 clubs and bars in vegas to start advertising.

Your favourite amateur stars on webcam hosted by $CUMINU. Models will be booked and tipped in $CUMINU tokens. $CUMINU will charge a 10% transaction fee.\n\nContent\nModels will be able to host a profile on $CUMINU that has a range of unlockable content. These will include photos and videos, private message requests and even NFTs.\n\nAma's\nPlans to host fortnightly AMA (ask me anything) with the biggest names in the industry. The sessions will have tiered membership determined by number of $CUMINU in the holder\u2019s wallet. Viewers will be able to purchase $CUMNIU before the AMA and tip the model throughout the session.\n\nTokenomics / Burn\nThey are going to charge 10% on all transactions through the site. Then use those funds to buy back the $CUMINU and burn them. This makes the token deflationary. OnlyFans isn't for all the degens as you have to give ID and hand over your credit card details. Being able to visit these sites and tip in crypto will be a big win. They\u2019re going to auction NFT's of the models during the AMAs. There are some crazy fans out there. Like the fanboys who buy $1m worth of bella delphines bath water a month. This has the potential to go viral and the AMA's blow up into big events.\n\nRoadmap\nThey reckon mid June for the site to be up and running and host their first AMA after with Tasha Reign soon after.\n\nOutlook\nThis is not financial advice but looks to be an easy moonshot (consider cumrocket). Liquidity locked. Team tokens locked. No whale wallets. Massive stars onboard. They'll use the profits to buy back tokens burning them making this deflationary. Just hold and ride the news highs.\n\nFor more information:\n\nChart: https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0x7b412f141996411401f57e2ba1bc2235af807d4d\n\nWebsite: http://cuminu.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/CumInuToken\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CumInuToken\n\nUniswap: https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xd6327ce1fb9d6020e8c2c0e124a1ec23dcab7536", "created_utc": 1622735073.0, "num_comments": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "score": 518, "is_original_content": false, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "comments": ["I was waiting for a coin like this, this will moon for sure \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25", "I\u2019m in, i always wanted to cum on the moon", "$7Million market cap?

The transaction fee is 8%, but each cycle will have different tokenomics in how that fee is distributed, designed for maximum growth potential. Each cycle last for 1 week initially, increasing to monthly cycles after that.\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown of each cycle:\n\n\u2618\ufe0f Growth cycle - prioritising liquidity generation to establish a solid baseline for future growth:\n\n\ud83d\udd25 1% burn\n\n\ud83d\udd25 3% yield\n\n\ud83d\udd25 4% liquidity\n\n\u2618\ufe0f Burn cycle - this cycle will accelerate the burn rate of the LEPRACOIN token, increasing rarity and capitalising on the previous growth phase:\n\n\ud83d\udd25 4% burn\n\n\ud83d\udd25 3% yield\n\n\ud83d\udd25 1% liquidity\n\n\u2618\ufe0f Rewards cycle - this cycle will use the growth achieved in the previous phases to reward holders:\n\n\ud83d\udd25 1% burn\n\n\ud83d\udd25 6% yield\n\n\ud83d\udd25 1% liquidity\n\n\u2618\ufe0f Charity cycle - this cycle is where the team gives back and shares its growth with those who need it most.

No other contract is like this.\n\nSupply:\n\nThe initial supply for LEPRACOIN is set to 82,000,000,000 or 82 billion. This will decrease on every transaction due to the burn mechanic built into the contract. The team it the supply at a relatively low number because we are all sick of losing count of the number of zero\u2019s of our holdings. This should simplify things for holders and ensure each LEPRACOIN has real value.\n\nThe supply is distributed as follows:\n\n\ud83d\udd25 5% for private sale - proceeds of which will be used for initial liquidity and locked\n\n\ud83d\udd25 5% to marketing wallet\n\n\ud83d\udd25 40% burned on launch\n\n\ud83d\udd25 50% for liquidity\n\nThere are no team tokens - this is a community coin.\n\nValues & Roadmap:\n\n\u2618\ufe0f The team brings transparency to the core of what they do.

As a coin made for the people, $MIGHTY by its own nature cannot be tanked by whales.\n\n\u2022 It takes a large amount of volume to push the price in one direction or another.\n\n\u2022 If you consider the fact that the sell order being placed is only 2.5% of the overall transaction, quickly you will understand that the small sell order is negligible relative to the overall volume. \n\n\u2022 The 10% fee transaction keeps the market liquid and the buyer safe; the lack of presale protects the buyers from whales. \n\nTokenomics \n\n\ud83c\udf15 Token supply: 1,000,000,000,000,000\n\n\ud83c\udf15 5% tax redistributed to holders\n\n\ud83c\udf15 5% added to LP each transaction\n\n\ud83d\udc4aTicker: $MIGHTY\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0fTelegram: [https://t.me/mightymaxtoken](https://t.me/mightymaxtoken)\n\n\ud83c\udf0eWebsite: [https://mightymax.xyz/](https://mightymax.xyz/)\n\n\ud83e\udd5eBuy on PancakeSwap: [https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x72392CE6BF8BBe413916BaEf9e6a0D6F74f7583C](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x72392CE6BF8BBe413916BaEf9e6a0D6F74f7583C)", "created_utc": 1622761155.0, "num_comments": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "score": 516, "is_original_content": false, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "comments": ["marketcap is still soo low now", "This is a real gem!

Or just to show off We aim to provide our customers with their personalised address, which they can choose themselves, or choose from a preset library.\n\n# How do we ensure safety and security? #\n\nWe use a technique called split-key vanity address generation. This is a type of vanity address, generated from one or more ECDSA private keys. The general use case is when a user makes a key-pair and only shares his public key. Everybody can use this public key to find the complementary public key leading to a vanity address. The user can then merge his private key with the complementary private key, leading to the private key of the vanity address. \n# In more simple terms:\n\n1. You generate 2 Keys , One is your private, one you send to us\n2. Using The key you sent us, we can generate the vanity address you want\n3. We then send back another code , which you merge to generate the address!\n4. Now you are the only holder of the private key, and your new vanity address.\n\n# How does the store work and how are prices determined?\n\nThe store allows you to specify your desired vanity address, the longer the number/letter, the more time consuming the generation is. This is why longer addresses are more expensive. Everything is paid in our tokens. 50% of all tokens used in a purchase are getting burned, an 20% is getting redistributed. the remaining 30% is used for servers. We are renting servers which use 5x 3090's to generate the addresses.\n\n# \ud83d\udcac Telegram: t.me/vanitytoken\n\n# \ud83c\udf10 Website: vanitytoken.net\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Some essential information about $VANITY: \n\n|Marketing/Vanity Generation|Burn|Reflection to holders|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|The marketing/Vanity Generation wallet receives 2% of transactions.

This is accomplished very simply by accumulating the 1.9% liquidity fees from every transfer in the token contract and sending them to the liquidity pool on every buy and sell. The amount of tokens awarded to LP token holders is 2.5% of every buy and sell, as long as there are sufficient tokens in the contract to pay the reward. On the release of O1T, 25% of the supply is initially sent to the contract to provide these rewards, and it is sustained by the liquidity fee on every transfer. Since 2.5% of every buy and sell is being rewarded to LP holders, and the liquidity fee is only 1.9% this results in a 0.6% deficit which allows the initial 25% of the supply that is in the contract to slowly enter circulation, until the contract is depleted and the liquidity fee can be reduced to 0%.\n           \n\nWe hope everyone in the community is as excited as we are for the future of O1T as we make history together!

We are a tracked listing now and there\u2019s no where to go but UP!\n\n2. We\u2019ve recently been listed on one of the 10 top CEXs in the world - [Digifinex.com](http://digifinex.com/)! With over a 100 cryptocurrencies, and being one of the leaders in liquidity and volume, Digifinex has brought us exposure to over 4 million trusted users that sees potential in $SENSI.\n\n3. Smart Staking is scheduled to be released in the coming weeks! (But before that\u2026)\n\n4. **$SENSI Locking is LIVE, NOW!**\n\nAs mentioned before, $SENSI\u2019s Smart Staking will be released in 2 stages: SENSI Locking, and then Smart Staking.\n\n**What are the differences between Smart Staking and $SENSI Locking?**\n\n*Smart Staking*\n\nSmart Staking will require BNB as input for a set, fixed term stake. The BNB will be used to stake in *10-15 different, pre-audited and whitelisted high-yield farms*, each day. The rewards and initial deposit will only be able to be collected **AFTER** the stipulated term is over. Smart Staking is inherently riskier than $SENSI Locking due to the fact that they are sent out to yield farms. However, the risk is compensated for through the diversification of the type of farms that the BNB is distributed to. What this means, is that if one farm makes a loss on any given day, the gains from the other farms will be able to mitigate the losses.\n\nRewards will be paid out to Smart Stakers in $SENSI, of which a certain percentage will be reflected to the *dynamic reward pool* for $SENSI Locking.\n\n*$SENSI Locking*\n\n$SENSI Locking is a steady, deflationary rewards program for $SENSI holders. Holders will be able to lock their tokens and be rewarded a percentage of the *dynamic rewards pool* (to be explained later), that is distributed to all $SENSI lockers daily. Lockers will be able to benefit from the inbuilt 4% token burn. The rewards will be paid out in $SENSI.\n\nSo what do we mean by a **Dynamic Reward Pool** for $SENSI Locking?\n\nYou see, we can\u2019t afford for our Reward Pool to be depleted, right? So what we\u2019ve done, was to promise a percentage of the reward pool to all $SENSI Lockers. The percentage is **NOT** fixed - it is dynamic and changes from day to day, depending on the reflected yield from Smart Staking - we expect this to be around 0.35% to 6% of the reward pool. This percentage of the reward pool will be distributed to all $SENSI Lockers by the amount that they have locked. \n\nFor example, if a total of 10 tokens were Locked, and you locked 1 token, you will receive 10% of the percentage of the dynamic reward pool that is paid out at the end of the day, i.e., if the pool has 1000 tokens and pays out 1% that day, you will receive (1% x 1000 x 10%) = 1 token as your reward for the day.\n\n**And why is this beneficial to all holders?**\n\n1. Since all the rewards are paid out in $SENSI, anyone who participates in Smart Staking are essentially paying for $SENSI.\n\n2. With the in-built burn mechanism AND a reflection of Smart Staking yield into the dynamic reward pool, $SENSI holders are automatically rewarded, AND this ensures a healthy and continuous buy order of $SENSI.\n\n3. Smart Stakers don\u2019t miss out, either. With a higher expected return due to the lowered amount of risk incurred through Smart Staking, it essentially ensures a much more acceptable reward-to-risk ratio. AND you get paid in $SENSI. Which grows with every transaction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Here\u2019s what\u2019s been done, and what\u2019s coming out, next.*\n\n**DONE:**\n\n1. $SENSI Locking OUT NOW!\n\n2. CoinGecko, Blockfolio listed.\n\n3. Digifinex listed, tradable now (SENSI/USDT)\n\n4. TechRate Audited\n\n**WHAT\u2019S COMING NEXT:**\n\n1. Smart Staking Release\n\n2.

I\u2019m just joining into coins that are completely safe to invest in and have a potentially high return rate to it. Today I\u2019ve found LitCoin which seems like quite a good investment, it does look really safe to put into - no large wallets or few wallets holding a large sum and also liquidity is burned and ownership is renounced, what more can you ask for? These coins usually smash a 100k Marketcap in the first day.\n\nThe coin is completely safe due to the fact that: \n\n1. Liquidity is all burned [This is same/equivalent to the liquidity being locked forever, if anything it\u2019s better]\n2. The ownership is renounced [The developer has no control over the coin, the only control he has is the on the advertisement - he cannot make any change to the contract or even touch the liquidity]\n\nHere are some proofs of this:\n\nContract: \n0xFe8eEf7D8E7373dE4d20739168Da7AaF1Cb9Fe39\n\nBurned Liquidity: \nhttps://bscscan.com/tx/0x35079c25852b08f561ebdcebc95ec65accbb059155fb82be044e3106873e8240\n\nRenounced Ownership: \nhttps://bscscan.com/tx/0xbf0209368b6c928274dcefe03b4e4026e78328e702ba1e8345522b6ef6b2c232\n\nThese two points in itself are a really good reason as to why you should buy into this coin, it is pretty much a risk free investment if you catch it under 50k Marketcap as these coins can fly past that in minutes. Me personally I buy in under $10k market cap - which is what I\u2019ve done here so that my minimum returns will be of 10x from here as this project easily has the potential to reach a $100k Marketcap especially with a developer as dedicated as the one on this project and a great community of holders behind him!\n\nAnyways, enough of the jibber jabber from me, here are some links you guys may find useful: \n\nTelegram:\nhttps://t.me/litcoinbsc\n\nWebsite:\nLitCoin.me\n\nAlso do remember guys, I am not a financial advisor, always do your own research - I\u2019ve left a few links so you are able to research into the coin :)\n\nTake care guys!

It\u2019s only a matter of time until cryptocurrency joins powers with this emerging industry. \n\nHow will this be done?\n\nThe plan is to pull funds from the project and use those funds exclusively to fund upcoming artists, in exchange for a shoutout of the project on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIn what ways will artists be funded?\n\nThere are a myriad of ways that we will help artists and here are some: \n\n1. Entirely pay off their concerts\n2. Entirely pay off studio sessions/ sound engineers\n3. Help rappers create albums/songs as exclusive NFTs which they can sell to their audience (this creates exclusivity)\n4. Help rappers create live performances as exclusive NFTs and auction them off (like DJ Don Diablo sold his concert for $1.2m)\n5.

It is a tremendous industry as massive volume of arts and related products are circulating. Yet there is no serious blockchain projects targeting this industry except this token which was launched couple weeks  ago on BSC and after an initial pump taking it to a 2.7M market cap it was dumped by the original devs who were pretty short-sighted. The contract was being rug proof and with the ownership renounced we the investors saw an opportunity to take over this project and take it to new heights. Therefore as community we took over the project realizing that there is no dedicated project targeting Anime/Manga/Hentai sector which is normally enournous especially in social media. Community implemented division of labour, created brand new site and has been contacting with well-known cosplayers and anime geeks on social media for promotion. \r\n\r\nThe past week we've dedicated our time into doing an AMA, creating a new website ( you must check it out) , designing a new logo, building connections with famous people in the manga and adult industry.\r\n\r\n Now that you're up to date with our background. Let the post begin!\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc8eAnimeTiddies ($TIDDIES)\ud83d\udc8e\r\n\r\nThe World\u2019s First +18 Anime/Manga/Comic NFT Marketplace where artists can sell their content as tradable NFTs.\r\nThe anime/manga/comic industry in the world is a harsh one.\r\nStudies have shown that the average Mangaka (manga artist) earns as little as $26,000 per year.\r\nMost are paid by price per page. Some have royalties and some doesn\u2019t.\r\nThe average working hour for a Mangaka is 12 to 15 hours per day.\r\nWith the low pay and high working hours, it\u2019s becoming less ideal to be a Mangaka.\r\n\r\nWe felt it was unfair for the artists to be treated this way\r\nbecause they have brought so much joy and happiness to their viewers.\r\n\r\nSo, we have decided to create a platform for Anime/Manga/Comic content creators to earn profits by selling their\r\ncontent as NFTs. In which, they would be paid fairly without any middleman.\r\nArtists fans will also be happy to know that their contributions in buying will directly be  known to the artists. (There will be a buyer\u2019s leaderboard on the artists profile page)\r\nThe platform will also allow artists to communicate with their fans directly on our platform.\r\n\r\nPiracy is also a big issue in this industry.\r\nWe\u2019ve done our research and will be deploying certain mechanism that will protect our artists from piracy.\r\nThis is needed so artists using our platform will be protected. This will give assurance to our future content creators.\r\n\r\nAny tokens can be used to buy the NFTs.\r\nThe NFT Profits Are Broken down into 3 groups,\r\n \u2043 Artists Commissions (50%, 60%, 80% based on tiers, more explanations will be available on the website)\r\n \u2043 10% will go to devs to keep the platform running\r\n \u2043 Remaining will go into a profit sharing staking pool.

Take a look at our graph and you will see that our price is steadily growing day by day, we are still trending on coin market cap and have some great investors. Join our ever growing community on telegram and speak directly with our helpful team.\n\nDexi is a newly released project that focuses on certain key targets in the world of cryptocurrency. Around 100 million people in the entire world are using cryptocurrency. A lot of people still do not know how to get into cryptocurrency and what cryptocurrency even is. We aim to solve this issue by introducing AR technology into the world of crypto. By combining AR with cryptocurrency, it unlocks a pathway where potential new investors have a fun and interactive way to collect crypto whilst also learning how to invest it wisely. This will not only increase the value of the crypto market as a whole but also protect new users from the affect of bear markets, pump and dumps, whales, and so forth.\n\nSo, what is Dexioprotocol? It is a new cryptocurrency launched on the Binance smart chain with a sticker symbol Dexi. It aims to implement a new new way of engagement to the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency using an Augmented reality application and crypto bounties place around the world. These token bounties will be available around the globe, think Pok\u00e9mon go but catching crypto rather than Pok\u00e9mon. The new app will also have your own private wallet (released this week), transaction tracking and of course an augmented reality camera allowing you to snap up those crypto bounties!\n\nEvents will be hosted through augmented reality. Our augmented reality bounties will offer great rewards when found. Our reason behind this is to offer a passive way to generate income by holding tokens, but also offer a way to make earning tokens more rewarding. Our bounties will take place around the globe and the app will notify the user when a bounty is near. All you need is your mobile phone. Do note that our puzzles will take effort to solve. But with great effort comes great reward!\n\nThe team are also researching the cardano Alonso network, once released our development team will start developing on their network and investigate its many available possibilities.\n\nOur project is developing a mobile application that is backed by our token. We\u2019ll introduce people to AR(augmented reality bounties). People across the globe will be able to hunt token bounties that will get hosted as events. This will make earning cryptocurrency fun and rewarding. Our white paper and website describe this feature. I hope you take the time to read through it.\n\nFor each dexi trade, three percent of it gets burnt, this increases its value in the long run. Three percent gets added to the liquidity pool and three percent gets rewarded to the holders of the token.\n\nThis system rewards the holders of the token and is a passive way of generating tokens.

We started with a few of us trying to understand the world of blockchains, dealing with the losses of rug pulls and honey pots, reviewing charity tokens, and overall the cryptocurrency space. We decided that it was time to create our own coin and to start the rise of the cat coins! As someone on our team had a siamese in their life, and it is one of the most recognizable cats, we decided it was time to start it!\n\nRamping up a token is rough with so much noise and scams out there that we wanted to ensure we have a solid foundation going forward. **We started with a DxSale on Monday, May 31st and have reached our cap of 100 BNB in less than 2 days.** The minimum was .05 with a maximum of .2 - we kept this low because we wanted a swell of people to be part of this community. As we hit our hard cap, we are looking at **500+ holders.** This has exceeded our expectations and cannot wait for our launch on **Friday, June 4th at 9AM EST on PancakeSwap**. This early pre-sale was done through word of mouth, friends, family, and communities we are part of today.

On launch day, we will be streaming the calling the sale final, this will then release $SIAM to those that took part in the pre-sale and will be available on PancakeSwap. Once that is released, we will be burning 20% of the coin (200,000,000,000), transferring the Community / Dev coins to their respective wallets, and answering any questions. Going forward, we will be burning 10% of $SIAM (100,000,000,000) over 100 days leaving the total circulating supply of 70% (700,000,000,000), taking 3% of the LP, burning the $SIAM coins, taking the BNB and splitting it 3 ways - 40% to charity wallet, 40% to holders on stream, 20% for SIAMESE NEKO team for buybacks, community, and marketing.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Quick Info:**\n\nSiamese Neko token is a community-driven cryptocurrency with daily active burns, rewards for holders, and donations to world wide causes.

Usually, people hate rats. When you mention rats, first associations are diseases, dirtiness etc. But like every other animal and creature in this world, rats also have their purpose. Rats are very important animals in animal food chain. They eat small insects, leftovers and everything they can find. And how they eat smaller animals and vegetables, they are also food for some bigger animals and predators. That's how nature works. Rats have played a big role in human history. They play a huge role in science, since they serve in various medicinal experiments. We test all kinds of drugs and other medicinal things on them, like organs transplantation etc.. Many of you don't know that rats are also very intelligent animals. They can be trained in various fields.\n\n Nowadays, they are mostly trained to find landmines, because of their great flair and low weight. Even if they step on a landmine, nothing is going to happen. So we think that rats deserve much more gratitude, and we, as a community, can show that gratitude. Our plans are to give some donations to organisations that work with rats. First planned donation is to a non profit organisation named \"APOPO\".

The project is spilt into two releases, known internally as V1 and V2. \n\n\nV1 has launched on the smart chain and is the early adopter phase. Building the community and increasing marketing funds. At this stage, the token will build a marketing pool that will then enable the devs to work with forward thinking companies to advertise their products. This stage is expected to last between 1-3 months.\n\nV2 is where the real development lies. The devs have already begun working with the Cardano network and developing the token to work with Smart Contracts. This will allow advertisers to being to fully realise the potential of the token. V2 will allow advertisers to directly interact with holders through buying/selling.

This aims to create both a store of value token that provides an adjustable interest; which will grow in value as the token gains mainstream adoption, as well as the implementation of transactional utility.\n\nWith the continual development of our project, alongside the impending mass adoption of cryptocurrency and Dogecoin, Dogecoin cash has the potential to sit alongside Dogecoin as the alternative store of value.

GamingNFT is looking to revolutionize the gaming NFT industry by making a platform that can integrate with games to create NFTs, have a marketplace, and you can also follow your favorite creator. The beta is almost out, but the User Interface looks promising so far!\n\nThey are fair launching with a max transaction limit, which is an awesome way to let people in, unlike a presale which gets dumped immediately!\n\nThey are locking all liquidity, and doing everything to gain the trust of the community!\n\nTheir marketplace is also looking to get into full blast soon after the beta, the dev team is just making final tweaks and wants the crypto launch to go well!\n\nGamingNFT token will be used to purchase NFTS, create NFTS, and even more!\n\nThe devs are based, and they released this statement on their love of gaming:\n\nWe have seen how much growth potential gaming has because we remember buying/selling skins, accounts, and or pickaxes. We are bringing the concept of NFTs (digital ownership which is no different than a legal deed to a house) to gaming because we believe in 'first move' advantage and we know that NFTs have huge potential for growth in the coming years.\n\nA description of NFTs and their potential:\n\n\u201cThe space is really early,\u201d Leydon said. \u201cI would describe NFT space as broken, as barely functioning. I was very fortunate to be at the beginning of the iPhone, and, more importantly, the beginning of in-app purchases. And I rode that wave up all the way up. What mattered was everybody was buying iPhones and Androids. And they all had in-app purchases. Everybody had to put their credit card to connect to their phone. So it made it very, very easy for me to be successful.

As we see it is just a waste of resources to invest in something with no engagement and user experience.\n\n RPX is the plan to provide the solution to this problem. The engagement from the game where users can use to engage in various token games. It is designed to inject gamification into the current blockchain ecosystem by starting with the commonly known game of rock, paper & scissors. \n\nThe goal of the project is to rapidly build a game-based token that users and owners can engage with as a means of entertainment while rewarding the user with economic reward and engagement based on the underlying value of the asset (RPX Token). \n\nWe will also add liquidity at 2 contract to avoid bot attacking us.\n\nTG:\nhttps://t.me/rpxbsc\n\nWebsite:\nhttps://rockpaperx.com/\n\nInstagram:\nhttps://instagram.com/rockpaper.x\n\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/rpxbsc \n\nRockPaperX\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\nLaunching soon!\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "created_utc": 1622726822.0, "num_comments": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "score": 19, "is_original_content": false, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "comments": ["Cool.

If Bobby Axelrod the unstoppable hedge fund manager from the TV Show Billions knew about Fire Token he would certainly buy and hold it because the Fire Token has all traits of a winner. Starting from its cheap price (7M Market cap) to its amazing team.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI knew that Fire Token was the best investment I could have done since the beginning thanks to their team that is amazing. For example, they got listed on CoinGecko one week after launch. Furthermore, they were listed on HotBit in the last 2 weeks. In addition, Fire Token was listed on CoinMarketCap last week !!!!!! The team is very proactive on making things happening. For example, although they were listed on CMC, they just hired a new UI/UX programmer and 2 new frontend programmers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother thing that got my attention was the fact that they had created an anti-whale mechanism that lasted 48 hours after launch. According with this mechanism any holder could not have more than 5M Fire Token in one account, which increased their number of holder tremendously and was fair for the community.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey also have a high marketing fund which is financed by 2% of every transaction. The marketing fund will be also used to finance other crypto projects in the behalf of the community which profits will be distributed through many ways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor instance, The profits from the angel investment on ICOs and Pre-sales will be used to re-buy Fire Token, which some will be burned and others added to the liquidity. The logo chosen by the community looks dope. I have a strong feeling regarding it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey are building a new website. It will be out very soon! It will allow for projects to apply for funding, which will give us a lot of partners. New poo coins ads soon and the goal for next month is to establish a legal identity behind Fire!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey also completed a successful AMA yesterday in which the team was very involved and explained to us many details about their plans for the future.

The market cap is only $50k and there are less than 100 holders - make sure to get in before 1,000. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of the concepts that separates AlphaEX from others is their weekly reward tokenomics. Right now, most BSC coins using automated reflections will never be listed on major exchanges (Coinbase, Binance) because those systems don\u2019t implement automated rewards. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlphaEX pays out its reflections in the form of rewards to true holders, by holding a portion of all reflections in a Reward wallet that will then disburse awards to wallets holding AlphaEX. Right now, the first disbursement hasn\u2019t occurred and the wallet contains 17% of all coin supply - don\u2019t miss your chance to be a holder!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCEX listing has been a goal of AlphaEX from the beginning and for that reason a \u201cCEX listing wallet\u201d will be made ready to use, and since it doesn\u2019t have an automated redistribution feature it will be much easier to get listed on the big exchanges. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFlex wallet is a very interesting concept too, and while there isn\u2019t much that can be said at the moment, please note that this will play a big part in future developments at AlphaEX. Stay tuned!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you\u2019ve read the White Paper (seriously check it out!), you\u2019ve seen that Excelsior is the future project that AlphaEX aims to develop. The dev team is serious about it, and once released every investor will be an owner since AlphaEx will be the main currency of Excelsior.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese guys are very open to receive suggestions and feedback to improve and get this as far as it can. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBe part of it!

They stuck around and manually refunded each individual user out of their own pocket - something never before seen in the DeFi crypto world!

As rugpulls themselves become more prevalent, solutions to combat them will experience a similar rise in demand and popularity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n With VEST from Starter, formerly known as BSCstarter, launched just yesterday, you can get in early to a coin that provides immutable liquidity locking and vesting services to IDOs on SEVEN different chains. Additionally, VEST already has a comprehensive list of coin clients who will be using their services as a result of their integration with the existing Starter launchpad--more on that below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon\u2019t attempt to mine crypto gold, a path fraught with rugpulls and fraud; instead, sell the liquidity-lock-mechanism shovels.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, VEST will be used for IDOs on seven chains, including ETH, AVAX, Matic, and ADA, not just the BSC. The aforementioned service information is entirely public, meaning anyone can see the liquidity locking and vesting schedules from tokens that use VEST. Investors will flock to such an interface, as it provides a user-friendly manner of showing which projects are safe to invest in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIDOs launched via BSCstarter (now known as just Starter as a result of its multi-chain compatibility) will automatically use VEST as their token and liquidity locking service. VEST doesn\u2019t need to restlessly search for clients it doesn\u2019t have--as an in-house utility addition to BSCstarter, VEST already has a plethora of tokens for its services.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1% of the liquidity pool from every V3 IDO will be reserved as staking rewards exclusively for VEST stakers. This is quite lucrative, providing guaranteed gains from every START IDO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is already $2M TVL, and it is in use by Starter, Verum Protocol, Jumble Cash, Mercor and BSCCROP. VEST isn't another meme fork. It provides a much needed solution to the incessant rugpull issue on the BSC AND all the other chains.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSell the shovels.

We are right up there when people search \u2018safemoon\u2019 ;)\n\n**Why is Safemoon Cash special?**\n\nFirstly, we are not the next Safemoon, rather, we are the 1st Safemoon Cash!\n\nSafemoon Cash is, in short, a rug-proof, ownership-renounced, 100% community-driven project that will, inspired by Safemoon, bring a multitude of use cases to the world of crypto. Bitcoin Cash reached an ATH of 0.25 Bitcoin. The first goal is for Safemoon Cash to reach 25% of Safemoon\u2019s peak market capitalization.\n\n**So why is Safemoon Cash different than Safemoon?**\n\nFirst of all: it is totally rug proof and community-driven. Nobody 'owns it', as ownership of the smart contract has been renounced and they can't touch their LP. Safemoon has a manual LP and Safemoon Cash has an auto-LP. Also, their tokenomics are superior to those of Safemoon. With its high transaction tax, it\u2019s the early holders of Safemoon that profit most. Every Safemoon Cash transaction incurs a 4% tax to the benefit of all. Safemoon Cash gives holders passive rewards (2%) through static reflection. 2% of each transaction is locked away in the Safemoon Cash liquidity pool, to create a steadily rising price floor. Safemoon Cash burned the liquidity after launching the token.\n\n**What has Safemoon Cash been up to and what's coming?**\n\nThey got a very driven and talented team that's in it for the long run. They have already achieved a lot and are just getting started:\n\n1. Techrate Audit and Rug Detectives Audit\n2. Listed on Delta, Blockfolio, CG, CMC, Stocktwits and many more\n3. Listed on exchanges XT.com and Probit\n4. Bibox on Saturday!\n5. Hotbit listing schedule will be announced soon\n6. Newly updated roadmap and Whitepaper (safemooncash.org/whitepaper)\n7. AMM contract (Safemoon Cash swap) incoming in the next days\n8. Local-to-global marketing structure with very active country groups on Telegram\n9. Deal with Chinese crypto marketing agency\n10. Amazing merch store\n\nMany more exchanges on the way! They are currently in discussions with (among others) Gate.io and Whitebit.\n\nThey got endorsements from adult models Sophie Dee (10.2M followers) and Richelle Ryan (3.2M followers), 4x Playboy cover Playmate Tayler Mercier (272K followers) and Playboy Playmate Yulia Foxx (355K followers).\n\nTikTok's from Andythesk (3.3M followers) Morgan Marshall (43K followers), Alex Podulucky (45K followers) and Skyz (276K followers).\n\nPromotions by numerous Twitter, Tiktok, Instagram and YouTube influencers daily! Their marketing spend budget is MASSIVE!\n\nYoung Troy (platinum producer) gave a shoutout on his song To The Moon. They made a video clip\n\nJuicy J did his own shout-out today! (2.7Mill followers)\n\nNumerous giveaways. Current contest is for a chance to win 20k!!\n\n**Other use cases?**\n\nYes! Safemoon Cash will within days introduce the Safemoon Cash Swap function on their website and within weeks introduce the Safemoon Cash Governance token (SMCG) and the Safemoon Cash Governance interface. SMCG holders, the community, can help shape the future of Safemoon Cash by influencing decisions concerning the project, such as proposing or deciding on new feature proposals (i.e. roadmap, hiring and staffing, charities, changes to governance parameters). Additionally, Safemoon Cash will introduce a yield farming protocol. It will be possible to farm the Safemoon Cash Governance token using Safemoon Cash.\n\nThis will lock up Safemoon Cash, thus decreasing selling pressure and increasing liquidity.\n\nTheir newly updated roadmap and Whitepaper is amazing. Go check it out: safemooncash.org/whitepaper. Safemoon Cash strives to be the number one used cryptocurrency for payments \u2013 but with Tokenomics. Big ambitions \u2013 but with it's dedicated community and team \u2013 Safemoon Cash can make this a reality.\n\n**What do you think?**\n\nName of the coin: SAFEMOONCASH\n\nWebsite: [safemooncash.org](https://safemooncash.org/)\n\nBuy Link: [v1exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xf017e2773e4ee0590c81d79ccbcf1b2de1d22877](https://v1exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xf017e2773e4ee0590c81d79ccbcf1b2de1d22877)\n\nAlternative to buy: bogged.finance/swap?token=0xF017E2773e4ee0590C81D79ccbcF1B2De1D22877\n\nGitHub: github.com/safemooncash/SafeMoonCash\n\nMedium: safemooncash.medium.com\n\nTwitter: [twitter.com/safemooncash](https://twitter.com/safemooncash)\n\nReddit: [r/SAFEMOONCASHCommunity](https://www.reddit.com/r/SAFEMOONCASHCommunity/)\n\nTelegram: [t.me/safemooncash](https://t.me/safemooncash)\n\nTikTok: tiktok.com/@safemooncash\n\nDiscord: discord.gg/6RAdMdXQ\n\nInstagram: [instagram.com/safemooncash](https://instagram.com/safemooncash)", "created_utc": 1622747871.0, "num_comments": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "score": 4, "is_original_content": false, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "comments": ["All $SAFEMOONCASH social links:\n\n[https://dxco.in/0xF017E2773e4ee0590C81D79ccbcF1B2De1D22877](https://dxco.in/0xF017E2773e4ee0590C81D79ccbcF1B2De1D22877)\n\n* Discord \u2705\n* Telegram \u2705\n* Twitter \u2705\n* Reddit \u2705\n* GitHub \u2705\n* Website \u2705"]}, {"id": "nr5vwb", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/nr5vwb/artificial_sun_sun_fair_launch_in_30_minutes_safe/", "title": "Artificial Sun $SUN Fair Launch In 30 Minutes!

Presale starts in 13 hours at 2PM UTC on June 3, contracts already audited, get in early!", "text": "Hello r/cryptomoonshots! I\u2019m excited to announce a newly developed twist on deflationary tokens: **ELONPEG**.  This token features the standard taxation/reflection mechanics (detailed below), but also an innovative framework for automatic burn: every time Elon tweets, the Burn Vault will automatically burn 0.5% of its supply. Just like USDT is pegged to the US Dollar and your mom pegged your dad, ElonPeg is pegged to volatility-inducing Elon tweets. \n\n**WEBSITE: https://elonpeg.com**\n\nA quick note about me: My name is Steve, and I\u2019m an IT executive, hobbyist crypto dev, and have been involved with crypto since the early days of BTC (2012, you can check my post history). You\u2019ve probably seen me here talking about Fox Finance where I remain a Tech Advisor, but I\u2019ve teamed up with some amazing crypto-junkies to launch an LLC, and with it ElonPeg and its amazing automation capabilities.\n\n# **\ud83d\udd25 So, what makes ElonPeg special? \ud83d\udd25** \n\nLet\u2019s get the basic tokenomics out of the way (also on the site):\n\n* 9% tax on every transaction: 3% to holders, 3% to liquidity, 3% to marketing, events, and carbon offsetting\n* 1 Trillion total supply, 500Bn has been sent to the BurnUponTweeting contract, and 420Bn will be up for grabs\n* The BurnUponTweeting contract (audited along with the token) which is called the Burn Vault starts with half the total supply. Every time Elon tweets, the function ElonTweeted(tweetId) is called, burning 0.5% (adjustable) of the Burn Vault supply. \n* In order to ensure the supply in the Burn Vault is still in circulation, all burn transfers will incur and pay out from the tax. Additionally, a \"reclaim\" function was added allowing a 2% withdrawal to the marketing wallet only every 50th Elon Tweet. It\u2019s doubtful it will ever be used unless begged to by the community for a major marketing/event push!\n\nBurnUponTweeting has been extensively tested in Testnet and we\u2019re all pretty excited about it. Elon Tweets are picked up within minutes, kicking off a process that burns the required amount, stores the tweet ID in the burn transaction record, [and sends alerts to the Telegram channel](https://imgur.com/a/kkOvHOq). We also hope to have this retweet and announce on Twitter in the future. You can read more info on the site and lite paper at elonpeg.com\n\n# **\ud83d\udcc8 Tell Us About the Presale \ud83d\udcc8** \n\nThe presale will be hosted on dxSale and will begin at 2PM UTC (in about 13 hours from this post) on June 3rd. Here\u2019s the details:\n\n* Soft/Hard Cap: 300/600BNB\n* Min/Max Buy-in: 0.1BNB/2BNB\n* Length: 4 hours\n* Liquidity Lock: 80%\n* Presale Price: 399,100,324 ELONPEG per 1 BNB (9% less than on Pancakeswap opening)\n* Liquidity add to Pancakeswap an hour after the Presale ends\n\nThe unlocked liquidity portion will be used to spin up some major marketing post-launch, and begin planning events. Also we\u2019ve seen a lot of folks ask why dxSale. Yes, it\u2019s a crazy platform with a ton of degens on it. But it\u2019s also decentralized, quick, with a low barrier to entry and no tiering. We\u2019ll be creating the presale and sharing the link 10 minutes before the start of the presale via social channels. \n\n# **\ud83d\udc40 How safe is this? \ud83d\udc40**\n\nAs always, the crypto world and the BSC can be fraught with scams and honeypots. Do your own research, come chat with us, whatever you need to feel comfortable. The team is highly responsive and extremely helpful and knowledgeable and the Telegram is very lively. Feel free to dig through my post history too!\n\nELONPEG does take security seriously. All contracts and the marketing wallet have been created from a Ledger hardware wallet, BurnUponTweeting was created to ensure half the supply isn\u2019t just sitting in a Metamask somewhere, and have run through countless tests on Testnet and revisions with auditors to ensure everything is exactly as it should be for the presale and launch.\n\n# **\ud83d\udce3 More Details \ud83d\udce3**\n\n**ElonPeg Contract:** https://bscscan.com/token/0xC18994df2Dfd0C2767bB1758bAe83e95762bBea3\n\n**BurnUponTweeting Contract:** https://bscscan.com/address/0xB016dE73a65eEF0C7D2f0a7BF236803e637e655D\n\n**Presale Link:** Will be posted to our social channels 10 minutes prior to presale (June 3, 9:50AM UTC)\n\n**Website:** https://elonpeg.com\n\n**Litepaper:** https://elonpeg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ELONPEG-Litepaper-06022021.pdf\n\n**Pre-Launch Audit:** https://github.com/TechRate/Smart-Contract-Audits/blob/main/ElonPeg.pdf\n\n**Telegram:** https://t.me/elonpeg\n\n**Twitter:** https://twitter.com/elonpeg\n\n**Instagram:** https://instagram.com/elon.peg", "created_utc": 1622682638.0, "num_comments": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "score": 92, "is_original_content": false, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "comments": ["This is a fantastic summary.

What mattered was everybody was buying iPhones and Androids. And they all had in-app purchases. Everybody had to put their credit card to connect to their phone.

I mean life-changing gains... \ud83d\ude09\n\nHere\u2019s a little fun fact for you:\n\nShiori ( \u7d2b\u7e54 \u3057\u304a\u308a , \"Purple Woven\") is a hany\u014d born from a human mother and a bat demon father. Many years following the event of her complicated family matter, she had established a hidden village for different hany\u014d to be together and being the head of the village.\n\nCoin Information:\n\nContract Address:\n\n0xeb24e3b0f5913424d46a0f2249e545577551eb98\n\nSlippage: 10-15%\n\nTG: [https://t.me/shioriinucoin](https://t.me/shioriinucoin)\n\n\ud83d\udc15Come and be a part of the Shiori Inu Army!

GamingNFT is looking to revolutionize the gaming NFT industry by making a platform that can integrate with games to create NFTs, have a marketplace, and you can also follow your favorite creator. The beta is almost out, but the User Interface looks promising so far!\n\nThey are fair launching with a max transaction limit, which is an awesome way to let people in, unlike a presale which gets dumped immediately!\n\nThey are locking all liquidity, and doing everything to gain the trust of the community!\n\nTheir marketplace is also looking to get into full blast soon after the beta, the dev team is just making final tweaks and wants the crypto launch to go well!\n\nGamingNFT token will be used to purchase NFTS, create NFTS, and even more! \n\n\nThe devs are based, and they released this statement on their love of gaming:\n\nWe have seen how much growth potential gaming has because we remember buying/selling skins, accounts, and or pickaxes. We are bringing the concept of NFTs (digital ownership which is no different than a legal deed to a house) to gaming because we believe in 'first move' advantage and we know that NFTs have huge potential for growth in the coming years.\n\n\nA description of NFTs and their potential: \n\n\u201cThe space is really early,\u201d Leydon said. \u201cI would describe NFT space as broken, as barely functioning. I was very fortunate to be at the beginning of the iPhone, and, more importantly, the beginning of in-app purchases. And I rode that wave up all the way up. What mattered was everybody was buying iPhones and Androids. And they all had in-app purchases. Everybody had to put their credit card to connect to their phone. So it made it very, very easy for me to be successful. And with NFT I see the exact same thing going on.\u201d\n\n\n\nTokenomics from the TG: \n- \nTotal Supply: 1,000,000,000,000,000 GAMINGNFT\n\n\n- 70% Of Supply Burned Before Launch\n\n\n- 2.5% Burn, 2.5% Redistribution to Holders\n\n\n- 5% Marketing Wallet (Locked), 3% Team Wallet \n\n\n- Contract is going to be hidden until launch to not get sniped by bots! Multiple contracts deployed to fool them as well.\n\n\nIn my honest opinion one to keep an eye out for, launch is in a couple of days. \n\n\nDYOR of course.

Just launched! Currently at 300k marketcap, with close to 2000 active telegram members, and growing! There is a fixed supply of 10 billion corgis with no inflation! Very early stage - anyone can buy a big chunk of the market supply for cheap and catch the ride to $1/CORGI.\n\n\u200bThe devs are in it for the long haul and committed to achieving USD Parity ($1/coin) for a $10b market cap.\n\n100% community owned: 100% of total supply locked and keys burnt (verifiable on BSCScan). CORGI is 100% community owned. In the spirit of decentralization, there are no large chunks owned by celebrities or other groups. All tokens are available for pups everywhere!\n\nCORGI lives on the Binance Smart Chain, so fees to transfer and exchange it are 100 times less than for ERC-20 tokens.\n\nTotal supply of 10bn tokens with no burn or inflation\n\nThe CORGI team is in this for the long haul. CORGI has a seasoned team of developers with deep experience in blockchain and financial markets.\n\nEndorsed organically by Drake Bell!

Paper hands are not welcome, although it is impossible to avoid them.\n\nSo what makes this different? Why should you invest? \n\nIf we can create a token that only crypto Bulls invest in, I believe it can be a success. Mix that in with high yield tokenomics (7% redistribution to holders) to discourage selling, and a promising road map and I believe we have a winner here. The team is small yet hard working. They have been working on social media promotions, improving the website, getting onto CoinGecko and cmc is next. There are also promises of more in the works, but one thing I like is they aren't promising lots of unachievable things.\n\nChallenges to overcome:\n\nAs an actual community token the team is well aware there are a lot of challenges ahead, but they are very open. The main struggle now is growth and traction, in a world with lots of memecoins it is hard to stand out. But as a community we are slowly gaining day by day. \n\nThe next challenge is being unique and developing $FTB purpose. The main use case is a store of value, but the team are also working hard to create other solutions to make FTB stand out. I believe it will be different from other coins who just promise an exchange or a wallet. \n\nThere is also HUGE potential! The token is only 1 week old and 50k market cap.\n\nI believe this token has potential but of course DYOR before investing.

What mattered was everybody was buying iPhones and Androids. And they all had in-app purchases. Everybody had to put their credit card to connect to their phone. So it made it very, very easy for me to be successful.

As the MC increases more giveaways will happen with larger Prizes.\n\n- Whitepaper / Audit soon\n\n- Aim to get listed on CEX ASAP.\n\n- Team is always working hard to deliver and everything so far has been self-funded by the Dev.\n\nCons:\nThe only real issue currently is the marketing delays which are out of our control as creators have been late so no more specific time frames will be given now to avoid dissapointment.\n\nNeeds people fluent in other languages to help spread the word to non english speakers (chinese, russian etc.)\n\n\nWhat their platform is going to offer:\n\nCams\nIt\u2019s just as the name suggests. Your favourite amateur stars on webcam hosted by $CUMINU. Models will be booked and tipped in $CUMINU tokens. $CUMINU will charge a 10% transaction fee.\n\nContent\nModels will be able to host a profile on $CUMINU that has a range of unlockable content. These will include photos and videos, private message requests and even NFTs.\n\nAma's\nPlans to host fortnightly AMA (ask me anything) with the biggest names in the industry. The sessions will have tiered membership determined by number of $CUMINU in the holder\u2019s wallet. Viewers will be able to purchase $CUMNIU before the AMA and tip the model throughout the session.\n\nTokenomics / Burn\nThey are going to charge 10% on all transactions through the site. Then use those funds to buy back the $CUMINU and burn them. This makes the token deflationary. OnlyFans isn't for all the degens as you have to give ID and hand over your credit card details. Being able to visit these sites and tip in crypto will be a big win. They\u2019re going to auction NFT's of the models during the AMAs. There are some crazy fans out there. Like the fanboys who buy $1m worth of bella delphines bath water a month. This has the potential to go viral and the AMA's blow up into big events.\n\nRoadmap\nThey reckon mid June for the site to be up and running and host their first AMA after with Tasha Reign soon after.\n\nOutlook\nThis is not financial advice but looks to be an easy moonshot (consider cumrocket). Liquidity locked. Team tokens locked. No whale wallets. Massive stars onboard. They'll use the profits to buy back tokens burning them making this deflationary. Just hold and ride the news highs.\n\n\nFor more information:\n\nChart: https://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0x7b412f141996411401f57e2ba1bc2235af807d4d\n\nWebsite: http://cuminu.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/CumInuToken\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CumInuToken\n\nUniswap: https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xd6327ce1fb9d6020e8c2c0e124a1ec23dcab7536", "created_utc": 1622685271.0, "num_comments": 24, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "score": 53, "is_original_content": false, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "comments": ["Everyday we stray farther from god.", "A meme and utility that makes the creators themselves more money.

INUPAD will help Projects in Marketing which makes them the best Launchpad in Current time.\n\nThe team is putting in blood and sweat to market the coin and is heavily community driven as they take advice/ opinions from community to get next influencer on board.\n\nWhat's happening now ?\n\n[Team has just launched their Roadmap] (https://twitter.com/INUPADOFFICIAL/status/1400505877598150656)\n\n[Recognised by a twitter crypto influencer with 78k followers](https://twitter.com/crypto_bearr/status/1400451341881790464?s=20)\n\n[Recognised by another twitter crypto influencer with 210k followers](https://twitter.com/therocketcrypto/status/1400436701718212611?s=21)\n\n\n[Post by a toktok influencer](https://www.tiktok.com/@crypto_makss/video/6969538117527194881)\n\n[Post by a youtube influencer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3VljRET5ng)\n\n\nInformation. about the INUPAD and Team\n\n* World\u2019s 1st Launch pad giving you rewards by launching meme & charity tokens.\n\n* \u2705 \ud83d\udd10\ud83d\udd10 [Super transparent team (all of the tokens locked on Team Finance]( https://team.finance/view-coin/0x607c0E60A4BB3E6e38882Db7042D55ce2Ceb52ea?name=InuPad%20Token&symbol=INU) (All team tokens are locked)\n\n* \u2705 [Ownership Renounced] (https://bscscan.com/tx/0x53db8deb7324c03fba4deaf58cc3bf39d5c9af8c49592a8b2dd82a499cb37dad)\n\n\nWhat are the advantages :\n\u200b\n\u2705 Rewards from Token Redistribution on transactions\n\ud83d\udd10 Verified token launches on the platform\n\ud83c\udf81 Fixed Allocation & Airdrops\n\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83e\udd1d\u200d\ud83e\uddd1\ud83d\udc36 Be a part of the fastest growing eco-system of meme & smallcap projects\n\u2705 [Contract] (https://bscscan.com/token/0x607c0e60a4bb3e6e38882db7042d55ce2ceb52e)\n\nWebsite : https://www.inupad.com\n\nPancak Link :  https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x607c0e60a4bb3e6e38882db7042d55ce2ceb52ea\n\nDextools : https://www.dextools.io/app/pancakeswap/pair-explorer/0x955e2b8aae6fedc6e0915eff059c700c6ef0110a\n\nYou can buy in on Pancake now.

Do you think that leading and novice blockchain developers and enthusiasts are plunged into chaos and can not unite to solve one big task? Recently, I discovered a real way to solve all these problems with the help of the Near Protocol project.  \n\n\nIn this article, we will touch on several aspects of the Near Protocol and go from general information to the benefits of unification in the crypto community. I will use an example to explain the pros and cons of using the Near Protocol, and we will also try to fundamentally understand how the price of the NEAR token will move in the future.  \n\n\nThe Near Protocol was founded a team of successful developers who have worked in companies such as Google, Facebook, MemSQL, Microsoft. The full list of the team can be found on the official website [https://near.org/team/](https://near.org/team/)  \n\n\nThanks to these guys, EVM Aurora was created, which is one of the most advanced EVMs in the cryptocurrency industry. Blockchain developers can use Aurora in their tasks without paying huge fees for creating smart contracts.  \n\n\nNow imagine that we are a novice blockchain developer who has almost no finances to start with. Due to the fact that the popularity of Ethereum is growing, we have huge commissions. For example, a normal smart contract deployment can reach up to $100-150, and if you are a completely inexperienced developer and have not limited the amount of gas to perform actions in a smart contract, then you can pay $200-300.  \n\n\nYes, of course, you can create a smart contract using Geth in conjunction with Mist, or use any other online code compiler, something like Remix. But when your code is ready, it will still have to be released to the main Ethereum network.  \n\n\nThe Near Protocol is designed to simplify and improve the development of decentralized applications (dApps) by reducing the cost of commissions and faster operation of the blockchain itself, compared to Ethereum.  \n\n\nMoreover, Near Protocol is a cross-chain protocol that will allow you to develop applications in the Near ecosystem and publish them in the Ethereum ecosystem, but due to the fact that Near assumes a more reduced price for gas, development can be started without having capital.  \n\n\nAlso, novice developers can grow to professionals thanks to a large number of conferences and training materials on the topic of development. But the strongest side of the project is the Near Protocol community. The project ecosystem is built on the basis of Guilds, which are distributed according to the tasks performed, from writing code to design and content.  \n\n\nGuilds in Near are in a hierarchical way. There is a certain guild leader who distributes responsibilities and monitors the progress of the work of its members. Along with the guild leader are developers, content creators and other figures of the crypto community. Each member receives a certain amount of Near as a reward for their work.  \n\n\nThere is no Fud or Trolling in the community itself. All members of the community are the most friendly and responsive guys. I was able to communicate with several guild leaders, as well as with some members of the team. Ideas for improving the project are listened to thoroughly and taken into account, which is good news.  \n\n\nTo be honest, this is the first time I've seen such an interested community. Every member of the team and guild is interested in implementing the most ambitious project plans. You can learn more about Guilds here [https://near.org/guilds/](https://near.org/guilds/) or write to me in telegram, where we can discuss joining the guild, or other information @LolSon\\_tg  \n\n\nAll in all, bringing minds together in the crypto community is, I think, a very successful solution. We saw something similar on Bitcointalk, when at the dawn of the cryptocurrency boom, every member of the BTT community contributed to the promotion of a particular project. The era of forums is passing, so the old method of promotion is replaced by a new one that unites users in groups to solve certain tasks.  \n\n\n**Let's summarize what advantages the project has for the crypto community:**  \n\n\n1. Its own EVM, which is used by the leading developers of the industry;  \n2. Blockchain with cross compatibility;  \n3. A strong and open community for new people;  \n4. Guilds that solve a huge number of tasks;  \n5. Experienced development team;  \n6. The NEAR token was placed on the largest exchanges, Binance, Huobi, Okex etc.  \n\n\nNow I propose to take a fundamental look at the Near Protocol and understand what the future of the project is. I don't want to use the knowledge of technical analysis to predict the price movement, I want to look at the project more globally, because I believe that it is worthy of attention.  \n\n\nFirst, a team that has won a huge number of world programming championships and has experience working in the world's largest IT companies. Secondly, its own blockchain with a lot of advantages, at least a very cheap transaction cost and at most unlimited scalability. Third, a powerful community that does not allow the project to get stuck in its development. Fourth, the placement of the token on the largest exchanges.  \n\n\nAll these factors suggest that the Near Protocol will be successful in the near future. I will not throw loud words like this is the second Ethereum or Bitcoin, I just suggest that you go into the rocket before it's too late. This is not a flip project that you will buy and sell in 24 hours, it is a real investment in a powerful project", "created_utc": 1622732510.0, "num_comments": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "score": 4, "is_original_content": false, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "comments": []}, {"id": "nrkrhg", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/nrkrhg/over_1500_telegram_member_already_get_in_now_and/", "title": "Over 1500 Telegram member already!

I have been looking at the Gamestop ethereum address for the past week to see what coins would be sent to them. Most of them were complete shit but this coin, Elysium, was different. It was the only coin on that list that actually had a website (https://elysiumtoken.live). I aped in the moment I saw they had a website and back then they were only at like 4 holders. Currently they are at 45 holders. This coin is a layer 2 oracle service that could be competition to Chainlink in the future. They have a legit dev team with many years of experience, and liquidity is also locked further confirming that this is a solid and legit project. On their roadmap you can see that marketing hasn't even started yet. In my opinion this is a guaranteed moonshot and I still can't believe I bought in so early. I'm excited to see what comes out of this project.\n\n**Why this coin has moonshot potential**\n\n-    An Oracle service with only 45 holders? wtf?\n\n-    Real fundamentals\n\n-    Crazy low market cap\n\n-    Liquidity is locked (meaning this is likely a real project)\n\n-   Has a real dev team with years of experience\n\n-    Marketing hasn't started yet, and will likely start with the platform launch on 6/5\n\n-    Not a BSC shitcoin, this coin is on Ethereum\n\n\nThis feels like a legitimate moonshot waiting to happen, and with a marketcap this low throwing in 0.1 eth might not be a bad idea.

I was very fortunate to be at the beginning of the iPhone, and, more importantly, the beginning of in-app purchases. And I rode that wave up all the way up. What mattered was everybody was buying iPhones and Androids. And they all had in-app purchases.\n\n Everybody had to put their credit card to connect to their phone.

Then CG is a lot easier to get when you're already on CMC, they take you more seriously. \n\nI think this is probably the best time to buy if you missed their initial launch. The team all seems super cool, I heard they've done some other coins in the last few weeks that broke 20million. I'll be shocked if this thing doesn't at least hit 5-10m in the next few days, which would be a 10-20x from current price. \n\nIt\u2019s a 10% transaction tax, 8% to liquidity and 2% split to holders, so use 11% or higher slippage. I like that they chose those numbers, cause most tokens that give too much to holders or burn, don\u2019t seem to do as well from my experience. Putting more in liquidity helps stabilize the price. Who cares if they split a bunch of tokens to you if the price isn\u2019t stable, right? \n\nContract: 0xf4bd4f939b9030700726f13adb7980238ea34689\nWebsite: https://www.swoledoge.biz/ \nTelegram: https://t.me/SwoleDogeToken \nOwnership renounced:  https://bscscan.com/tx/0xe0f34c72734b94331fc45defdd3cda51e712ed8b2af1f063179ed29d1a81c03a", "created_utc": 1622687733.0, "num_comments": 10, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "score": 122, "is_original_content": false, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "comments": ["Prime time, baby!

The platform is called Lexit and it seems to me like a really unique idea that has the potential to explode if the devs deliver.\n\nThe team behind Lexit is transparent and professional. All of them are proved veterans in their fields and the roadmap looks amazing. They have a team of around 15-25 devs that are actively working on the project.\n\nTheir coin, which is the utility token for Lexit, has already launched on BSCpad and is now available for trading on Bitmart and PCS:\nhttps://www.bitmart.com/trade/en?layout=basic&symbol=LEXI_USDT\n\nCoingecko listing:\nhttps://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lexit\n\nAddress:\nhttps://bscscan.com/address/0x41a95f152e50fffd7184d9388956a2d0b8756ba9\n\nTaken from Lexit.com:\n\nIMAGINE, you could turn your Art, Music, Film, Books and ALL kinds of Inventions like\u2026 Source Code or even Patents into NFTs and have them available RIGHT AWAY to anyone & everybody on DeFi Liquidity Pools.\n\nThat is LEXIT. Want to hear the best part? We WON'T charge you ANYTHING until you're successful with your NFT Launch.\n\nThe journey begins with the Artist or Inventor creating an NFT via our LEXIT platform. It continues with their NFT being offered on our NFT launchpad to everyone who wishes to participate. While simultaneously supporting the Artist or Inventor, our users are obtaining NFTs that could be of great benefit to themselves.\n\nLEXIT DeFi Pools\n\nThe LEXIT DeFi Pools are a natural extension of our NFT Launchpad.\u00a0Instead of using MULTIPLE services & platforms, we thought it would be AWESOME that our users can do EVERYTHING on a single platform. So we did JUST THAT!\n\nOur DeFi Pools can be opened up by any LEXIT user. All you have to do is just stake SOME liquidity yourself. The DeFi Pools will feature FLEXIBLE asset pairs and be open to other projects who are in need of liquidity and want to benefit from the LEXi Coins\u00b4 performance.\n\nLEXNET DeFi Protocol\n\nLEXIT is built upon our OWN Protocol, the LEXNET. The LEXNET Blockchain is a highly performant EVM (Ethereum & Forks of it) compatible novel protocol. It features smart contracts and a dynamic validator pooling among other innovative hallmarks. The LEXNET prototype projects a hashrate of 32,000 TPS (transactions per Second) with further scalability at future demand.\n\n--\n\nRemember always DYOR!", "created_utc": 1622757222.0, "num_comments": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "score": 1, "is_original_content": false, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "comments": []}, {"id": "nrp27s", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/nrp27s/aquagoat_will_moon_communityled_charitydriven/", "title": "AquaGoat will moon!

We are bringing the concept of NFTs (digital ownership which is no different than a legal deed to a house) to gaming because we believe in 'first move' advantage and we know that NFTs have huge potential for growth in the coming years.\n\nA description of NFTs and\u00a0their potential:\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe space is really early,\u201d Leydon said. \u201cI would describe NFT space as broken, as barely functioning. I was very fortunate to be at the beginning of the iPhone, and, more importantly, the beginning of in-app purchases. And I rode that wave up all the way up. What mattered was everybody was buying iPhones and Androids. And they all had in-app purchases. Everybody had to put their credit card to connect to their phone. So it made it very, very easy for me to be successful. And with NFT I see the exact same thing going on.\u201d\n\nTokenomics from the TG:\u00a0\n\n\\-\u00a0Total Supply: 1,000,000,000,000,000 GAMINGNFT\n\n\\- 70% Of Supply Burned Before Launch\n\n\\- 2.5% Burn, 2.5% Redistribution to Holders\n\n\\- 5% Marketing Wallet (Locked), 3% Team Wallet\u00a0\n\n\\- Contract is going to be hidden until launch to not get sniped by bots! Multiple contracts deployed to fool them as well.\n\nIn my honest opinion one to keep an eye out for, launch is in a couple of days.\u00a0\n\nDYOR of course. But this is one of the more promising coins on CMS right now!", "created_utc": 1622732768.0, "num_comments": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "score": 3, "is_original_content": false, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "comments": []}, {"id": "nrnxbd", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/nrnxbd/sunnycoin_charity_token_recently_fair_launched_2k/", "title": "\ud83d\udd25 SunnyCoin - Charity Token - Recently fair launched - 2k Marketcap - 100x potential \ud83d\udcc8", "text": "Welcome Sunshines of the day!\n\nJoin our telegram for all info: \n\n[https://t.me/SunnyCoins](https://t.me/SunnyCoins)\n\nSunnyCoin is a 100% community-driven environment-saving charity token on the Binance Smart Chain aiming for renewable energy.\n\nThe SunnyCoin aims to be a revolution in the merge of renewable energy into the world of cryptocurrency. After a confronting statement of mr Musk in regards tot he energy sources used for bitcoin mining, we can all agree some things have to change.  \n\nWhile some of us hope their coin will reach the sun, we decided to use the power of the sun here on earth, alongside your insane profits you will make. SunnyCoin uses a SunnyWallet, which will slowly fill up over time and will 50% be used to compensate the carbon footprint of cryptocurrency. The other 50% will be used to donate to renewable energy research, focusing on solar energy. It can be as cheap at 0.30$ to compensate for a tonne of CO2, meaning that even the smallest purchases of the SunnyCoin can already help the compensation greatly!\n\nThe SunnyWallet fills up with 10% of every transaction. Additionally, 5% is added tot he liquidity pool, to provide a natural growth of the coin. Lastly, deflation of the coin is provided by a burn of 5% of the transaction.\n\nBecause we like to launch and maintain a healthy rug-free coin, we refrain from any sort of presale. The liquidity is also locked for 50 years, and ownership is renounced. Since the coin just recently fair launched the market cap is still extremely low. This will make the price pump atleast 10x or even 100x. Every small buy will be heavily increasing the token price (especially in the beginning). After the initial post on CMS, we plan to expand the marketing to other platforms including TikTok and Discord. When we reach a point of 600 hodlers, we will create our own reddit page to maintain a healthy, bright and sunny community.\n\nSafeForest Tokenomics and Features:\n\nLiquidity locked automatically through DXSale  \nNo hidden team token  \nNo \"marketing wallet\", devs are using their own personal BNB to provide further trust!  \nRenounced Ownership  \nAll liquidity locked for 50 years\n\n\ud83d\udd255% Burn per transaction to make the token deflating!  \n\ud83d\udca65% Liquidity per transaction added!

GamingNFT is looking to revolutionize the gaming NFT industry by making a platform that can integrate with games to create NFTs, have a marketplace, and you can also follow your favorite creator. The beta is almost out, but the User Interface looks promising so far!\n\nThey are fair launching with a max transaction limit, which is an awesome way to let people in, unlike a presale which gets dumped immediately!\n\nThey are locking all liquidity, and doing everything to gain the trust of the community!\n\nTheir marketplace is also looking to get into full blast soon after the beta, the dev team is just making final tweaks and wants the crypto launch to go well!\n\nGamingNFT token will be used to purchase NFTS, create NFTS, and even more!\u00a0\n\nThe devs are based, and they released this statement on their love of gaming:\n\nWe have seen how much growth potential gaming has because we remember buying/selling skins, accounts, and or pickaxes. We are bringing the concept of NFTs (digital ownership which is no different than a legal deed to a house) to gaming because we believe in 'first move' advantage and we know that NFTs have huge potential for growth in the coming years.\n\nA description of NFTs and\u00a0their potential:\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe space is really early,\u201d Leydon said. \u201cI would describe NFT space as broken, as barely functioning. I was very fortunate to be at the beginning of the iPhone, and, more importantly, the beginning of in-app purchases. And I rode that wave up all the way up. What mattered was everybody was buying iPhones and Androids. And they all had in-app purchases. Everybody had to put their credit card to connect to their phone. So it made it very, very easy for me to be successful. And with NFT I see the exact same thing going on.\u201d\n\nTokenomics from the TG:\u00a0\n\n\\-\u00a0\n\nTotal Supply: 1,000,000,000,000,000 GAMINGNFT\n\n\\- 70% Of Supply Burned Before Launch\n\n\\- 2.5% Burn, 2.5% Redistribution to Holders\n\n\\- 5% Marketing Wallet (Locked), 3% Team Wallet\u00a0\n\n\\- Contract is going to be hidden until launch to not get sniped by bots!

There was lots of  \"Doge\" coins before CorgiCoin, but none that have performed as well as $Corgi the last 3 weeks.  It is going to be an even more incredible June for the #CorgiArmy and here is some information and my interpretation.  CorgiCoin has potential for 30x from current market price.  That would be a market cap  of $22,000,000.  This is a very achievable goal and great opportunity to build wealth on The Smart Chain.\n\nI have spent several days observing their chat on Telegram and the development team is transparent and happy to answer all questions.  Despite running a random \"Air Drop\" promotion, the average transaction remains high.  Because the DEVs \"burned\" the key to the liquidity there is sufficient liquidity for large trades without moving price.  Also burned key means that the liquidity pool will remain strong as Corgi passes a market cap of $1,000,000, $5,000,000 and soon enough a $10,000,000.\n\nThe current price remains close to all time highs, as the larger market has struggled these last couple days Corgi has been tightening up with higher lows.  I look forward to a large 50%+ swing to new all time high as $Corgi passes a $1,000,000 market cap in less than 28 days thanks to the dedicated team and clear understanding of market trends and needs.  The team is already working with high profile artists to bring NFTs to BSC, where the CorgiArmy can use $Corgi to satisfy our desire for digital art and memes.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Current: 739,000 BUSD**\n\nMarket Cap History via PooCoin: \n\n6/2: 718,200 BUSD\n\n6/1: 705,000 BUSD\n\n5/31: 333,000 BUSD\n\n5/30: 517,000 BUSD\n\n5/29: 330,000 BUSD\n\n5/28: 269,000 BUSD\n\n5/27: 324,000 BUSD\n\n5/26: 327,000 BUSD\n\n5/25: 360,000 BUSD\n\n5/24: 322,000 BUSD\n\n5/23: 311,000 BUSD\n\n5/22: 390,000 BUSD\n\n5/21: 303,000 BUSD\n\n5/20: 180,000 BUSD\n\n5/19: 148,000 BUSD\n\n5/18: 121,000 BUSD\n\n5/17: 140,000 BUSD\n\n5/16: 143,000 BUSD\n\n5/15: 165,000 BUSD\n\n5/14: 88,000 BUSD\n\n5/13: 12,100 BUSD\n\n5/12: 8,300 BUSD\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLaunch: May 12th, 2021\n\nWallets:  13,993 addresses\n\nTransactions:  18,040 \n\n Average Transfer Amount: 3158236.6948631173  Corgi\n\nContract: 0x450dCf93160A30BE156A4600802c91BF64dFFD2E\n\nCorgiCoin Whitepaper: [https://corgicoin.net/whitepaper.pdf](https://corgicoin.net/whitepaper.pdf)\n\n[https://charts.bogged.finance/?token=0x450dCf93160A30BE156A4600802c91BF64dFFD2E](https://charts.bogged.finance/?token=0x450dCf93160A30BE156A4600802c91BF64dFFD2E)", "created_utc": 1622702172.0, "num_comments": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "score": 12, "is_original_content": false, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "comments": ["Get $LUCKY", "All $CORGI social links:\n\n[https://dxco.in/0x450dCf93160A30BE156A4600802c91BF64dFFD2E](https://dxco.in/0x450dCf93160A30BE156A4600802c91BF64dFFD2E)\n\n* Discord \u2705\n* Telegram \u2705\n* Twitter \u2705\n* Reddit \u2705", "I will research $Lucky, I love how $Corgi is community owned and the DEVs burned the key to the liquidity pool.

We are officially SAFER THAN SAFEMOON. \n\nUltrasafe's tokenomics allow for 4% of every transaction to be distributed to the liquidity pool and 4% to be reflected among holders. Whale wallets are also extremely small compared to any other token.\n\nWhat's making me most bullish about this coin is the seemingly very well-connected team, who else does a CG listing at launch? They're following through on promises, the whitepaper actually showed where money is going, they seem to know what they're doing and have connections, no gimmicks, constantly getting the coin added to new platforms, complete transparency with their goals and a clear roadmap for success. \n\n- Listed on a Centralized Exchange (LBank)\n\n- Broken multiple world records on BSC and has already gained over 33k+ dedicated holders\n\n- Listed on Coingecko on day 1\n\n- 2 Audits which show that the coin is safer than even Safemoon. 3rd in future plans.\n\n- Devs doxxed themselves and showed faces during both AMA\u2019s. Future full dox planed, some staff doxed fully on website (unlike some of the coins promoted here that just rug)\n\n\nAccording to the team, there's multiple things in the works, including: dApp, NFTs, UltraWallet, exchange, merchandise, CMC listing, More CEX listings down the road (already in talks with 3), more AMAs(2 already both wonderful), Influencer and Social Media based marketing, Billboards, Planes, Times Square, outsourced and animated Website v3.\n\nA \u201cBig Whale\u2019 called Randal has recently invested 500k this week into our project and has insured investors he is here for the long run! Amazing sign of faith in such an early project.\n\nWith so many milestones already reached, the team is already hard at work. They have a new Whitepaper coming very soon, a second audit by Certik is already underway for this week and there's a completely redesigned version of the website that was just launched Wednesday after our AMA.. V3 in the works and coming soon!\n\nIt is currently the best entry point prior to crypto recovery. Come make some money with the UltraSafe community!!\n\nImportant Links:\n[PancakeSwap](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x0b3f42481C228F70756DbFA0309d3ddC2a5e0F6a)\n[UltraSafe Finance](https://ultrasafe.finance/) - \n[Solidity](https://solidity.finance/audits/UltraSafe/) - \n[Certik](https://www.certik.org/projects/ultrasafe) - \n[BscScan - 34k](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0b3f42481C228F70756DbFA0309d3ddC2a5e0F6a) - \n[CoinGecko Listing](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ultrasafe) -", "created_utc": 1622646029.0, "num_comments": 145, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "score": 196, "is_original_content": false, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "comments": ["Just look at the chart, we are about to explode!

I was just making my DYOR and a new concept has captured my attention.\n\nThe project in question is [Amnext](https://amnext.xn--io-pka/). Initially I was intrigued by the name that literally is an abbreviation of \u201cI am the next \u201c. I started an investigation on the project and discovered a cutting-edge feature that I have never heard of, the concept of **Lifetime Lottery Ticket.**\n\nI am not a lottery player and even though I do not believe in gambling, I was very impressed by Amnext and its innovation in this field.\n\n**The main features of Amnext are:**\n\n* *Lifetime Lottery Ticket*\n* *No-Loss Lottery*\n* *Staking Rewards*\n* *Referral Rewards*\n* *Rewards in AMC by depositing in Prize Pools*\n* *Doxxed Developers*\n\nLifetime Lottery Overview:\n\nThe **Lifetime Lottery** follows an easy but smart procedure. Once a user buys the lifetime ticket the funds are sent to the **Amnext Staking protocol**, it will generate Interest.\n\nThis is where the magic happens. The interest produced is accrued to the to the lifetime jackpot depository which allows users to **keep their lottery tickets forever** without the necessity of putting in money repeatedly to participate on the drawing of the next lottery.\n\nIn simple terms, the money used to buy the tickets **does not become the jackpot** as it happens in classic/national lotteries but it is used to generate the interest, which will form the jackpot and allow **the birth of the lifetime ticket!**\n\nNo Loss Lottery Overview:\n\n**Another unbelievable concept** inside the Amnext ecosystem is the **No-Loss Prize Pools.**\n\nThe members can deposit funds in different stable and well-trusted Tokens like **BNB/CAKE/USDT.**\n\nThe amount deposited follows the same workflow similar to the lifetime lottery protocol.

They fought back - and WON!\n\nWith Freedom Juice, Big Dave wants us all to become the bathtub distiller, HODLing our Freedom Juice while we gather a Nation of Juicers who fight for Liberty and the right to Live Free or Die! Tokenomics are as follows: Total supply: 1,000,000,000,000 Tax: 10% (Breakdown: 4% Liquidity, 4% HODLers, 2% Marketing Budget) This marketing budget and solid tokenomics makes Freedom Juice destined for greatness. Contests and giveaways are going on and it\u2019s really helping to grow the already fun community.\n\nThe initial pump at launch will be sustained not just by consistent marketing, but also through development of solid use cases\u2014including NFTs! Post launch, the Development team\u2019s focus is to create the NFT \u201cNo Freedoms Taken\u201d Marketplace. On the Freedom Juice NFT Marketplace, HODLers will be able to buy, sell, create, and donate their own NFTs. In this way, Freedom Juice HODLers can successfully evade the cuckolds of the IRS.\n\nFreedom Juice Holders will not only get to enjoy the massive gains this project promises, but will also get to keep ALL of their gains (as they should!).\n\nFreedom Juice launches this FRIDAY JUNE 4th, 2021 THE TIME TO ACT IS NOW!

It seems more comprehensive than bsc scan eu and is free unlike rugscreen. Additionally the devs have promised more features. They promise that while Gem dapps will always be free some of the new features will be only for holders. They are almost to 2500 hodlers so cmc and coingecko are imminent. Sitting below a $2m MC with a usable product this is a major find and early on. A direct competitor to Bogged and Poocoin at less than a penny on the dollar in market cap. This is truly amazing!\n\nInstructions to use: Open\u00a0www.gemprotocol.io\u00a0on your trust browser and choose an app it's as simple as that. LP is fully locked. Ownership is not renounced as this is an actual working utility but dev is not allowed to pull liquidity or mint new tokens merely administrative access to maintain the system and to do things the community wants. Just yesterday they changed slippage from 4% to 12% because too many whales were swinging the price. It is now stable after that. Those kinds of things aren't possible in a community token. Obviously dyor but how often do you find an actual working utility that's innovative and unlike anything else available (like Portfolio tracker) for under $2m market cap? You don't usually.

GamingNFT is looking to revolutionize the gaming NFT industry by making a platform that can integrate with games to create NFTs, have a marketplace, and you can also follow your favorite creator. The beta is almost out, but the User Interface looks promising so far!\n\nThey are fair launching with a max transaction limit, which is an awesome way to let people in, unlike a presale which gets dumped immediately!\n\nThey are locking all liquidity, and doing everything to gain the trust of the community!\n\nTheir marketplace is also looking to get into full blast soon after the beta, the dev team is just making final tweaks and wants the crypto launch to go well!\n\nGamingNFT token will be used to purchase NFTS, create NFTS, and even more!\u00a0\n\nThe devs are based, and they released this statement on their love of gaming:\n\nWe have seen how much growth potential gaming has because we remember buying/selling skins, accounts, and or pickaxes. We are bringing the concept of NFTs (digital ownership which is no different than a legal deed to a house) to gaming because we believe in 'first move' advantage and we know that NFTs have huge potential for growth in the coming years.\n\nA description of NFTs and\u00a0their potential:\u00a0  \n \\[\u00bf\\`\u00a6  \\[\u00bf\\`\u00a6  \\[\u00bf\\`\u00a6  \\[\u00bf\\`\u00a6 \n\n\u201cThe space is really early,\u201d Leydon said. \u201cI would describe NFT space as broken, as barely functioning. I was very fortunate to be at the beginning of the iPhone, and, more importantly, the beginning of in-app purchases. And I rode that wave up all the way up. What mattered was everybody was buying iPhones and Androids. And they all had in-app purchases. Everybody had to put their credit card to connect to their phone. So it made it very, very easy for me to be successful.

Please don't be shy and join our young community now.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83c\udf49 What is The Melon App\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Melon App is the first blockchain-based Social Media Platform in the world that works on cryptocurrency instead of Likes. Melon users can give and receive our cryptocurrency Melons instead of Likes and finally get rewarded in real-time for their creativity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2728\u00a0Vision:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCreate the first blockchain-based Social Media Platform that will reward original content creators. On The Melon App, we will not be able to exchange Likes with each other, but our cryptocurrency Melon. Each \"Like\" equals one Melon on the app, which goes directly to the content creator. No more annoying ads or different content to spamming our feeds. Every Melon profile can determine any amount of Melons to follow them, starting from 0 Melons. These Melons can be exchanged to fiat currency in real-time on our application. When you hold Melons, you will receive a constant appreciating amount through our Tokenomics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udcb2\u00a0Tokenomics:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere will be a total of 50,000,000,000 Melons in Supply, from which they have already burnt 50%. They have chosen a relatively small total supply to grant fair rewards to content creators on their posts with Melons that actually have value.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, they have an 8% Fee for every Melon transaction. From that, 5% will be redistributed between all the Melon holders. The other 3% will be burnt and added forever to our automatic Liquidity Pool for the Token. Half of that will be kept in Melons, whereas the other half will immediately be kept in BNB. This ensures constant growth and less volatility. The dev team will keep 2% of the supply in the marketing & development wallet, locked for one month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2696\ufe0f\u00a0\u00a0Fair DxSale Launch Soon:\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJoin the Melon Token before its official launch & benefit even more. The DxSale will launch on Friday. Join our official Telegram account to be updated constantly about the release time. The Dev team there is continuously online and open for any requests.

This is especially great for the casual investor during this volatile market, to invest at a discount price and HODL. At the same time, whenever you buy PIPO you build the community up, and the trust around the network, which will drive the price higher.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur launch strategy is focused on building a strong community while giving investors the opportunity to get in on the ground floor. We\u2019re focusing on a targeted marketing strategy to help us build a strong community, starting first with the crypto community.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe plan to launch a network app for the people, which will be backed by the community. Our long-term focus will be bringing PIPO to a larger audience, through social media.

Can We Trust SafeWojak\nWell, here\u2019s my 2 cents.\n\nThey have burnt almost all of their liquidity pool tokens. This is as safu as it gets in this minefield of a market.\n\nDev\u2019s are almost always available to answer my questions, and to a level of competency I can appreciate.\nProposed tools are in alpha testing, beyond the typical projects posted on BSC which are merely in the conceptual stages.\n \n3. Wojanomics\n5% Tax on transactions, where\n      3% Redistributed, to myself and all fellow Wojaks alike  \n      2% Development Fund, makes sense - they need some way to sustain the project\n\nAs mentioned earlier, they have burnt the LP, which is incredibly rare.

GamingNFT is looking to revolutionize the gaming NFT industry by making a platform that can integrate with games to create NFTs, have a marketplace, and you can also follow your favorite creator. The beta is almost out, but the User Interface looks promising so far!\n\nThey are fair launching with a max transaction limit, which is an awesome way to let people in, unlike a presale which gets dumped immediately!\n\nThey are locking all liquidity, and doing everything to gain the trust of the community!\n\nTheir marketplace is also looking to get into full blast soon after the beta, the dev team is just making final tweaks and wants the crypto launch to go well!\n\nGamingNFT token will be used to purchase NFTS, create NFTS, and even more!\u00a0\n\n\nThe devs are based, and they released this statement on their love of gaming:\n\nWe have seen how much growth potential gaming has because we remember buying/selling skins, accounts, and or pickaxes. We are bringing the concept of NFTs (digital ownership which is no different than a legal deed to a house) to gaming because we believe in 'first move' advantage and we know that NFTs have huge potential for growth in the coming years.\n\n\nA description of NFTs and\u00a0their potential:\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe space is really early,\u201d Leydon said. \u201cI would describe NFT space as broken, as barely functioning. I was very fortunate to be at the beginning of the iPhone, and, more importantly, the beginning of in-app purchases. And I rode that wave up all the way up. What mattered was everybody was buying iPhones and Androids. And they all had in-app purchases. Everybody had to put their credit card to connect to their phone. So it made it very, very easy for me to be successful. And with NFT I see the exact same thing going on.\u201d\n\n\n\nTokenomics from the TG:\u00a0\n-\u00a0\nTotal Supply: 1,000,000,000,000,000 GAMINGNFT\n\n\n- 70% Of Supply Burned Before Launch\n\n\n- 2.5% Burn, 2.5% Redistribution to Holders\n\n\n- 5% Marketing Wallet (Locked), 3% Team Wallet\u00a0\n\n\n- Contract is going to be hidden until launch to not get sniped by bots!

GamingNFT is looking to revolutionize the gaming NFT industry by making a platform that can integrate with games to create NFTs, have a marketplace, and you can also follow your favorite creator. The beta is almost out, but the User Interface looks promising so far!\n\nThey are fair launching with a max transaction limit, which is an awesome way to let people in, unlike a presale which gets dumped immediately!\n\nThey are locking all liquidity, and doing everything to gain the trust of the community!\n\nTheir marketplace is also looking to get into full blast soon after the beta, the dev team is just making final tweaks and wants the crypto launch to go well!\n\nGamingNFT token will be used to purchase NFTS, create NFTS, and even more!\u00c2 \n\n\nThe devs are based, and they released this statement on their love of gaming:\n\nWe have seen how much growth potential gaming has because we remember buying/selling skins, accounts, and or pickaxes. We are bringing the concept of NFTs (digital ownership which is no different than a legal deed to a house) to gaming because we believe in 'first move' advantage and we know that NFTs have huge potential for growth in the coming years.\n\n\nA description of NFTs and\u00c2 their potential:\u00c2 \n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The space is really early,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Leydon said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would describe NFT space as broken, as barely functioning. I was very fortunate to be at the beginning of the iPhone, and, more importantly, the beginning of in-app purchases. And I rode that wave up all the way up. What mattered was everybody was buying iPhones and Androids. And they all had in-app purchases. Everybody had to put their credit card to connect to their phone. So it made it very, very easy for me to be successful. And with NFT I see the exact same thing going on.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\n\n\nTokenomics from the TG:\u00c2 \n-\u00c2 \nTotal Supply: 1,000,000,000,000,000 GAMINGNFT\n\n\n- 70% Of Supply Burned Before Launch\n\n\n- 2.5% Burn, 2.5% Redistribution to Holders\n\n\n- 5% Marketing Wallet (Locked), 3% Team Wallet\u00c2 \n\n\n- Contract is going to be hidden until launch to not get sniped by bots!

Everything from Liquidity to website development is completely community driven.\n\n**Tokenomics**: The tokenomics are exactly like the ETH Bomb, arguably the original deflationary token. 1% of a transaction is burned by the contract, with no limits on how many you can buy or sell or ponzi redistribution of tokens. This burn has been incredibly effective, with over 120 million tokens burned from the modest 1% burn rate.\n\nIn the coming weeks the lotto is coming as well. Currently there is an airdrop in the works and you still have time to get in early before the bombs start flying.\n\nfBomb is sitting at a mere 120k marketcap, which is tiny compared to Spookyswap's 11 million marketcap, or even an unoriginal memecoin like fshiba's 2 million marketcap. I don't know about you, but this looks like the absolute bottom to me.\n\n**Some key points about the Fantom Opera Network** \\-\n\n\\>Fantom is a fast, cheap, scalable, decentralized L1 network with a unique consensus mechanism, aBFT.\n\n\\>Why is it called Fantom 'Opera'? Fantom derived it's name from the play 'Phantom of the Opera', so it's only fitting to go with that naming convention.\n\n\\>Just how fast is the Opera chain? Blazing fast. It's the fastest blockchain with Smart Contracts, with 0.7s block time and 1 second Time to Finality.\n\n\\>Just how cheap are transactions on the Opera chain? Very cheap! A transaction costs 0.01 Fantom, which is 0.003$. A single Fantom will be enough for you to make 100 transactions!\n\n**Do you want to join us and be part of history?**\n\nCome check it out!\n\nWebsite: [https://fbomb.finance](https://fbomb.finance/)\n\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/fBombOpera](https://twitter.com/fBombOpera)\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.gg/wT5wYk8p](https://discord.gg/wT5wYk8p)\n\nSetting up Metamask for Fantom Opera:\n\n[https://docs.fantom.foundation/tutorials/set-up-metamask](https://docs.fantom.foundation/tutorials/set-up-metamask)\n\nHow to buy Fantom:\n\n[https://fantom.foundation/where-to-buy-ftm/](https://fantom.foundation/where-to-buy-ftm/)\n\nPrice charts:\n\n[https://charts-spooky.zoocoin.cash/](https://charts-spooky.zoocoin.cash/)\n\nFTMscan contract page:\n\n[https://ftmscan.com/token/0x8503eb4a136bdbeb323e37aa6e0fa0c772228378](https://ftmscan.com/token/0x8503eb4a136bdbeb323e37aa6e0fa0c772228378)\n\nSpookyswap:\n\n[https://spookyswap.finance/swap](https://spookyswap.finance/swap)\n\nSee you on the other side, *bombardiers*!", "created_utc": 1622693530.0, "num_comments": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "score": 10, "is_original_content": false, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "comments": ["SafuMoon $SAFUMOON\r  \n\r  \nThe next 1000x memecoin with the raddest logo and website ever!

GamingNFT is looking to revolutionize the gaming NFT industry by making a platform that can integrate with games to create NFTs, have a marketplace, and you can also follow your favorite creator. The beta is almost out, but the User Interface looks promising so far!\n\nThey are fair launching with a max transaction limit, which is an awesome way to let people in, unlike a presale which gets dumped immediately!\n\nThey are locking all liquidity, and doing everything to gain the trust of the community!\n\nTheir marketplace is also looking to get into full blast soon after the beta, the dev team is just making final tweaks and wants the crypto launch to go well!\n\nGamingNFT token will be used to purchase NFTS, create NFTS, and even more!\u00c2 \n\n\nThe devs are based, and they released this statement on their love of gaming:\n\nWe have seen how much growth potential gaming has because we remember buying/selling skins, accounts, and or pickaxes. We are bringing the concept of NFTs (digital ownership which is no different than a legal deed to a house) to gaming because we believe in 'first move' advantage and we know that NFTs have huge potential for growth in the coming years.\n\n\nA description of NFTs and their potential:\n\nThe space is really early,Leydon said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would describe NFT space as broken, as barely functioning. I was very fortunate to be at the beginning of the iPhone, and, more importantly, the beginning of in-app purchases. And I rode that wave up all the way up. What mattered was everybody was buying iPhones and Androids. And they all had in-app purchases. Everybody had to put their credit card to connect to their phone. So it made it very, very easy for me to be successful. And with NFT I see the exact same thing going on.\n\n\n\nTokenomics from the TG:\n-\nTotal Supply: 1,000,000,000,000,000 GAMINGNFT\n\n\n- 70% Of Supply Burned Before Launch\n\n\n- 2.5% Burn, 2.5% Redistribution to Holders\n\n\n- 5% Marketing Wallet (Locked), 3% Team Wallet\n\n\n- Contract is going to be hidden until launch to not get sniped by bots! Multiple contracts deployed to fool them as well.\n\n\nIn my honest opinion one to keep an eye out for, launch is in a couple of days.\n\n\nDYOR of course. But this is one of the more promising coins on CMS right now!", "created_utc": 1622735723.0, "num_comments": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "score": 0, "is_original_content": false, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "comments": []}, {"id": "nr9prr", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/nr9prr/blaze_token_new_tokencommunity_driven_charity/", "title": "\ud83d\ude80BLAZE TOKEN: New Token/Community Driven Charity Coin 2,100+ Telegram Members!

When I say that I mean people that have been software developers and crypto enthusiasts/traders their entire lives. They aren't just a bunch of influencers/marketers looking for a pump and dump, and as a result have created an amazing token that is actually unique. I have sat in the community since the beginning and I can see that this is a project that is built to survive, which is proven by the fact that we retained more of a market cap than any of the other pump coins during the market slump.\n\n# What makes this project so unique?\n\nThey introduce the concept of a wallet tier, where the longer you hold the less tax you pay on your transactions. They have already got a DiamondSwap interface in the works and they are planning to add governance so that we (the community) can dictate where the project goes.\n\nOne of the long term goals of the project is the token is to be used amongst community members to play games, via an arcade/casino.\n\nAnother aspect of the coin which I find actually fascinating is that there is this new **temporary burn** protocol that they've built into their coin, called phantom tokens. These are tokens that are hidden from everyone's wallets and materialize at a later time.

If you\u2019re curious, check out the chart, the data speaks for itself. Can you out hold a holder? Join us in the telegram and find out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis token is meant to be fun. The telegram will not be banning fudders. We believe it will be fun to watch the community pick sides and encouraging one another to sell first. Who can out hold who on this token.  \n\n\nPros:  \n\u00b7 Contract Source Code Verified  \n\u00b7 The large transactions fees rewards holders and discourages pump and dumps.  \n\u00b7 Liquidity Locked  \n\u00b7 High transaction fees discourages pump and dumps.  \n\u00b7 TechRate Free Audit = Pass (Standard Audit to come after more holders)  \n\u00b7 Viral potential  \nCons:  \n\u00b7 Weak token use case.  \n\u00b7 Dev team is not doxx  \n\u00b7 High transaction fees.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have any questions about the token, feel free to ask. We\u2019re more than happy to answer any questions you might have. However, this token is going to be as simple as it gets. With the high transaction fee, holders will be rewarded. On the flip side, early adopters will be able to secure a large position.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTokenomics:  \n\ud83d\udcf7 Total Supply: 505,050,505,050  \n\ud83d\udcf7 50% Transaction fee  \n\ud83d\udcf7 40% Fee to all holders  \n\ud83d\udcf7 10% Fee added to liquidity\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdditional Information:  \n\ud83d\udcf7 Telegram:\u00a0[https://t.me/Token5050](https://t.me/Token5050)  \n\ud83d\udcf7 Website:\u00a0[https://www.5050token.net](https://www.5050token.net/)  \n\ud83d\udcf7 BSC Scan:\u00a0[https://bscscan.com/token/0x0530c188397cfef801150ccd733f4ad2e809b0d6#balances](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0530c188397cfef801150ccd733f4ad2e809b0d6#balances)\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Contract: **0x0530c188397CfeF801150ccD733F4ad2E809B0d6**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: If you receive gas fee error on PancakeSwap, change the last digit of the token and transaction should go through.", "created_utc": 1622688231.0, "num_comments": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "score": 10, "is_original_content": false, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "comments": ["Great concept"]}, {"id": "nqrxjg", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/nqrxjg/bkpr_new_token_launching_4_hours_from_now/", "title": "$BKPR | new token launching 4 hours from now.", "text": " \n\nFinally good to be sharing another project with you guys.

Here is how it works: Every transaction is taxed with a 11% fee.\u00a0 This fee is split into 4 components and, consequently, helps us to achieve the following:\n\n**5% goes to the liquidity pool**\n\nThis automatically decreases price volatility and contributes to a continuously-increasing price floor of our $BKPR token.\n\n**2% goes to $BKPR holders**\n\nThis means that you, as a holder, automatically earn $BKPR, sent to your wallet in near real-time when others trade $BKPR.\n\n**2% goes to charity projects**\n\nThis means that our charity wallet value automatically increases in size for awesome projects when someone trades $BKPR.\n\n**2% goes to the company wallet**\n\nThis allocation enables continued and accelerated development of BeeKeeper as we move forward on an organisational and commercial level.\n\nIn addition to the transactional burn, we plan to manually burn coins upon achieving various milestones - more on that later.\n\n\ud83d\udda5 WEBSITE: [https://beekeeper.community/](https://beekeeper.community/)\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 INSTAGRAM: [https://www.instagram.com/beekeepertoken/](https://www.instagram.com/beekeepertoken/)\n\n\ud83d\udde3 TELEGRAM: [https://t.me/BeeKeeperTG](https://t.me/BeeKeeperTG)\n\n\ud83d\udcf2 TWITTER: [https://www.twitter.com/BeeKeeperToken](https://www.twitter.com/BeeKeeperToken)\n\nJOIN TELEGRAM FOR MORE INFO\n\n\ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udc1d", "created_utc": 1622656720.0, "num_comments": 16, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "score": 51, "is_original_content": false, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "comments": ["Ready to go!!", "The devs are so professional on this one it's like I'm investing in an actual company", "Waited for this one for quite some time now :)"]}, {"id": "nr49l8", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/nr49l8/happy_apes_doxxed_active_mc_25k/", "title": "\ud83d\udc35 Happy Apes \ud83d\udc35 | Doxxed & Active | MC 2.5k", "text": "What truly makes a community token?

It is a tremendous industry as massive volume of arts and related products are circulating. Yet there is no serious blockchain projects targeting this industry except this token which was launched couple weeks  ago on BSC and after an initial pump taking it to a 2.7M market cap it was dumped by the original devs who were pretty short-sighted. The contract was being rug proof and with the ownership renounced we the investors saw an opportunity to take over this project and take it to new heights. Therefore as community we took over the project realizing that there is no dedicated project targeting Anime/Manga/Hentai sector which is normally enournous especially in social media. Community implemented division of labour, created brand new site and has been contacting with well-known cosplayers and anime geeks on social media for promotion. \r\n\r\nThe past week we've dedicated our time into doing an AMA, creating a new website ( you must check it out) , designing a new logo, building connections with famous people in the manga and adult industry.\r\n\r\n Now that you're up to date with our background. Let the post begin!\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc8eAnimeTiddies ($TIDDIES)\ud83d\udc8e\r\n\r\nThe World\u2019s First +18 Anime/Manga/Comic NFT Marketplace where artists can sell their content as tradable NFTs.\r\nThe anime/manga/comic industry in the world is a harsh one.\r\nStudies have shown that the average Mangaka (manga artist) earns as little as $26,000 per year.\r\nMost are paid by price per page. Some have royalties and some doesn\u2019t.\r\nThe average working hour for a Mangaka is 12 to 15 hours per day.\r\nWith the low pay and high working hours, it\u2019s becoming less ideal to be a Mangaka.\r\n\r\nWe felt it was unfair for the artists to be treated this way\r\nbecause they have brought so much joy and happiness to their viewers.\r\n\r\nSo, we have decided to create a platform for Anime/Manga/Comic content creators to earn profits by selling their\r\ncontent as NFTs. In which, they would be paid fairly without any middleman.\r\nArtists fans will also be happy to know that their contributions in buying will directly be  known to the artists. (There will be a buyer\u2019s leaderboard on the artists profile page)\r\nThe platform will also allow artists to communicate with their fans directly on our platform.\r\n\r\nPiracy is also a big issue in this industry.\r\nWe\u2019ve done our research and will be deploying certain mechanism that will protect our artists from piracy.\r\nThis is needed so artists using our platform will be protected. This will give assurance to our future content creators.\r\n\r\nAny tokens can be used to buy the NFTs.\r\nThe NFT Profits Are Broken down into 3 groups,\r\n \u2043 Artists Commissions (50%, 60%, 80% based on tiers, more explanations will be available on the website)\r\n \u2043 10% will go to devs to keep the platform running\r\n \u2043 Remaining will go into a profit sharing staking pool. (For $TIDDIES/BNB LP Stakers)\r\n\r\n$TIDDIES also have deflationary tokenomics to improve value + price stability.\r\n \u2043 Total Supply (100,000,000,000)\r\n \u2043 Antiwhale (no more than 1% of total supply can be held on a wallet)\r\n \u2043 Every transaction has a 10% tax (8% goes to LP, 2% distributed to holders)\r\n\r\nWe shall be filing to get listed on CoinGecko and Coinmarketcap in the next few days.\r\nCome help us grow and be part of the perkiest community in crypto!\r\n\r\nWe have the power of anime and tiddies on our side so #GrabTIDDIES!\r\n\r\n\ud83d\ude08\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n\r\nWebsite \u26aa\r\nhttps://animetiddies.io\r\n\r\nTelegram \u26aa\r\nhttps://t.me/animetiddiescommunity\r\n\r\nDiscord \u26aa\ufe0f\r\nhttps://discord.gg/SCeRaj6Ufp\r\n\r\nTwitter \u26aa\r\nhttps://twitter.com/tiddiestoken \r\n\r\n\r\nVerified Contract:\u26aa\r\nhttps://bscscan.com/address/0x2c7FD21F49937477FAb50a96B0c55211cF7BD6cA#code \r\n\r\nOwnership Renounced:\u26aa\r\nhttps://bscscan.com/tx/0x09cd9ea5c4f7d7aa8f603e2a80afe6026d4d923c26e91d12503aaa47f8dc5433\r\n\r\nChart:\u26aa\r\nhttps://www.dextools.io/app/pancakeswap/pair-explorer/0x971b52bb638d9e07c9b85fb7d83b30fe0d7809a7\r\n\r\nPancakeSwap:\u26aa\r\nhttps://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?inputCurrency=BNB&outputCurrency=0x2c7FD21F49937477FAb50a96B0c55211cF7BD6cA", "created_utc": 1622663445.0, "num_comments": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "score": 35, "is_original_content": false, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "comments": []}, {"id": "nqszrd", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/nqszrd/seimoon_seiyamoon_launching_in_pancake_almost_1/", "title": "$SEIMOON - SeiyaMoon launching in Pancake almost 1 hour!

GaiaDAO takes advantage of deflationary tokenomics, so you get rewarded simply for holding. \ud83d\udc99\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n*After many early morning video conferences, a lot of coffee and some long nights we have created something we are really proud to launch to the public. GaiaDAO was built from the ground up, with smart contracts, the website, social media, marketing, videography and basically anything you see all done in-house.*\n\n* PRESALE SOLD OUT IN 5 SECONDS \ud83d\udd25\n* WHITEBIT LISTING COMING SOON\n* Extremely low market cap\n* Over 1500 holders\n* Over 2,500,000 $GAIA burned\n* Over 3,900,000 $GAIA in donations wallet (\\~$12,600)\n* First donation of $5,000 made to The Water Project on May 6, 2021\n* Second donation of $5,000 made to; Orangutan Outreach Project ($2200), World Vision ($1600), and Rainforest Foundation USA ($1190) on May 19, 2021.\n\n**GaiaDAO is 100% transparent. Team tokens are locked. AMA has been done and smart contracts have been submitted for audit. This isn\u2019t your average charity coin. This is a long-term project. They have taken the time to put together something that has real applications in the blockchain space.**\n\nGaiaDAO can help to offset some of the negative aspects of blockchains by actively supporting the Earth we live in, while also providing a decentralized financial platform that will benefit Gaians (hodlers of GAIA \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e).\n\n**MORE IN-DEPTH INFO:**\n\nThe[ website](https://gaiadao.org/) goes into more details on the actual tokenomics and structure of GaiaDAO.\n\nWhile you\u2019re there, feel free to check out the team page. They have background info on their amazing web devs, incredibly talented backend devs, social media gurus, marketing specialists and much more.\n\n**None of this matters without YOUR help.

The beta is almost out, but the User Interface looks promising so far!\n\nThey are fair launching with a max transaction limit, which is an awesome way to let people in, unlike a presale which gets dumped immediately!\n\nThey are locking all liquidity, and doing everything to gain the trust of the community!\n\nTheir marketplace is also looking to get into full blast soon after the beta, the dev team is just making final tweaks and wants the crypto launch to go well!\n\nGamingNFT token will be used to purchase NFTS, create NFTS, and even more!\n\nThe devs are based, and they released this statement on their love of gaming:\n\nWe have seen how much growth potential gaming has because we remember buying/selling skins, accounts, and or pickaxes. We are bringing the concept of NFTs (digital ownership which is no different than a legal deed to a house) to gaming because we believe in 'first move' advantage and we know that NFTs have huge potential for growth in the coming years.\n\nA description of NFTs and their potential:\n\n\u201cThe space is really early,\u201d Leydon said. \u201cI would describe NFT space as broken, as barely functioning. I was very fortunate to be at the beginning of the iPhone, and, more importantly, the beginning of in-app purchases. And I rode that wave up all the way up. What mattered was everybody was buying iPhones and Androids. And they all had in-app purchases. Everybody had to put their credit card to connect to their phone. So it made it very, very easy for me to be successful. And with NFT I see the exact same thing going on.\u201d\n\nTokenomics from the TG:\n\nTotal Supply: 1,000,000,000,000,000 GAMINGNFT\n\n70% Of Supply Burned Before Launch\n\n2.5% Burn, 2.5% Redistribution to Holders\n\n5% Marketing Wallet (Locked), 3% Team Wallet\n\nContract is going to be hidden until launch to not get sniped by bots! Multiple contracts deployed to fool them as well.\n\n\u00ae [^$>[\u00bf$\u00ac\u00ac [> [\u00ac[\u00a1\n\nIn my honest opinion one to keep an eye out for, launch is in a couple of days.\n\nDYOR of course.

The  Ascension Launchpad will be a crosspad   launchpad that can launch coins  on chains that all have the same   address as your ETH/Smart Chain  address. This means chains such as ETH,   Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche,  and more. The benefits to Ascension   holders is that every project has  to guarantee a certain percentage   airdrop to the Ascension holders ! So all holders will receive an   airdrop of IDO regardless if they\u00a0want to participate or not. The tier   system will be based on how much you own on how much you are allowed to   contribute. Those in the private DAO  are guaranteed allocations.   Projects that are added are guaranteed to  be added to investments   strategies to have constant buy pressure to  their projects, no fee for   using our IDO launchpad, advisement from our  team and much more ! \n\nAlso, there is a private DAO that will get allocations to other projects on top of the guaranteed and larger allocations then regular ascend holders! Only 80K ASCEND needed to join.\n\nFunctionality behind ASCEND:  *ASCEND    ecosystem requires a tax on  every transaction. Collected tax is   divided  1:1 between a pool for  Lock Liquidity Function and ASCEND   holders  proportionally to their  ownership of circulating supply.   Procuring more  tokens will allow a  wallet address to move up/ascend to a   higher tier,  which in turn  allows the wallet to pay a  smaller  fee    percentage  on   its   transactions.  The  higher  the  tier  the  lower    the  tax    percentage  is.  The  highest  tier,  also  known  as   \u201eGod   Mode\u201c,    offers  the  perk  of  paying  no  taxes  whatsoever.* \n\n*A      2% liquidity pull (Ascension  Event) can occur if the value of the      BNB/ASCEND liquidity pool has risen  at least 10% in value from the      previous pull. This liquidity pull  requires a proposal to be voted  and     executed by the community to  initiate. This is to prevent abuse  of   the   price by whales to drain the  liquidity of the contract  among  many   other  reasons. Pulled liquidity is  then used by DAO via   Ascension   Strategies  to generate profits.*\n\n*All       of the funds from the pull go to the DAO when the community votes   on  a   strategy to be used with the excess liquidity. The three   strategies   the  protocol has in place right now are BuyBurn,   BuyASCENDDistribute,   and  BuyToken. The BuyBurn strategy will allow   users to vote for   liquidity   pulls to be used to buy back ASCEND   tokens and then   immediately burn the  entire amount purchased,   reducing the circulating   supply and therefore  increasing the value of   the remaining tokens. The   BuyASCENDDistribute   strategy will allow   users to vote for liquidity   pulls to be used to buy  back ASCEND   tokens and then immediately  airdrop  those tokens back to   Ascend   holders that held at the time of  the  Ascension strategy passing.  The   BuyToken strategy will allow users  to  vote for liquidity pulls to be     used to buy any token that is  listed on  Pancakeswap and then allow   for  users to claim those tokens  on the DAO  dashboard.*\n\nThe snipe listing bots will be available to the DAO in the upcoming weeks and will offer a wide range of benefits to holders. Other bots that are still in development are front-run bots, trading bots, sentiments bots and more.\n\nHolding ASCEND also gives you access to 3D NFTs in the future and free airdrops to other coins.\n\n [https://t.me/AscensionProtocolChat](https://t.me/AscensionProtocolChat) \n\n [https://v1exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xf664264e835bc27cbf71da6a6633a6c7b99b9de1](https://v1exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xf664264e835bc27cbf71da6a6633a6c7b99b9de1)", "created_utc": 1622614938.0, "num_comments": 22, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "score": 377, "is_original_content": false, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "comments": ["I've been in this project for a few months now, it may not go as fast as you want, but it's definitely not a rug - it's completely outside of the realm of possibility at this point and the dev has been one of the most dedicated that I've seen in all projects I've been in. \n\nThe future is between ok and very bright here, ideal for medium or long term investments.", "i dont understand how this dev stays so dedicated in the current market lol.
